Like Berkshire, the five\\ncompanies are reluctant to issue shares.\\nAn additional benefit for Berkshire is the possibility that our investment may lead to\\nopportunities for us to partner around the world with five large, well-managed and well-respected\\ncompanies. Their interests are far more broad than ours. And, on their side, the Japanese CEOs\\nhave the comfort of knowing that Berkshire will always possess huge liquid resources that can be\\ninstantly available for such partnerships, whatever their size may be.\\nOur Japanese purchases began on July 4, 2019. Given Berkshire’s present size, building\\npositions through open-market purchases takes a lot of patience and an extended period of\\n“friendly” prices. The process is like turning a battleship. That is an important disadvantage which\\nwe did not face in our early days at Berkshire.\\nThe Scorecard in 2023\\nEvery quarter we issue a press release that reports our summarized operating earnings (or\\nloss) in a manner similar to what is shown below.

I followed with a short summary of the outlook for\\nthe full year: (1) most of our non-insurance businesses faced lower earnings in 2023; (2) that\\ndecline would be cushioned by decent results at our two largest non-insurance businesses, BNSF\\nand Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) which, combined, had accounted for more than 30% of\\noperating earnings in 2022; (3) our investment income was certain to materially grow because the\\nhuge U.S. Treasury bill position held by Berkshire had finally begun to pay us far more than the\\npittance we had been receiving and (4) insurance would likely do well, both because its\\nunderwriting earnings are not correlated to earnings elsewhere in the economy and, beyond that,\\nproperty-casualty insurance prices had strengthened.\\n11\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"Ch5TVfHFxa7CaTeF9VIXKIPBEkfBf0IXulh7VGndWHc=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_11":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_11\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":11,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Insurance came through as expected. I erred, however, in my expectations for both BNSF\\nand BHE. Let’s take a look at each.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nRail is essential to America’s economic future. It is clearly the most efficient\\nway – measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity – of moving heavy materials to distant\\ndestinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must travel to\\ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can’t run without\\nrail, and the industry’s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American\\nbusinesses, railroads eat capital.\\nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad\\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted\\nother fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least\\n$500 billion to replicate those assets and decades to complete the job.\\nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain its present\\nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested,\\nbut it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries.\\nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years\\nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $1 1⁄2 billion annually. Ouch! That sort of\\ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall considerably short of\\nBNSF’s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad’s debt. And that we do not\\nintend to do.\\nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less\\nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That’s no\\nsurprise to me or Berkshire’s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a\\nsmall fraction of its replacement value.\\nNorth America’s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and\\nexported goods, etc. one-way for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for\\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization\\nof track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I\\nsit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees\\nworking under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions.\\nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the\\ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must\\ndeal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or\\nmentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car,\\nextraordinarily heavy train that can’t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be\\nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more\\ncommon in Europe and will always be with us.\\n12\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"p/ZBbQF6wW+RcVLpVWKXjxwWm3mvWlEg6qJwt0nVzHU=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_12":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_12\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Wage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and\\nCongress. Additionally, American railroads are required to carry many dangerous products every\\nday that the industry would much rather avoid. The words “common carrier” define\\nrailroad responsibilities.\\nLast year BNSF’s earnings declined more than I expected, as revenues fell. Though fuel\\ncosts also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country’s inflation\\ngoals. This differential may recur in future negotiations.\\nThough BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five\\nsince our purchase. I believe that our vast service territory is second to none and that therefore our\\nmargin comparisons can and should improve.\\nI am particularly proud of both BNSF’s contribution to the country and the people who\\nwork in sub-zero outdoor jobs in North Dakota and Montana winters to keep America’s\\ncommercial arteries open. Railroads don’t get much attention when they are working but, were\\nthey unavailable, the void would be noticed immediately throughout America.\\nA century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of\\nBerkshire. You can count on that.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last year occurred at BHE. Most\\nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as\\nexpected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or\\neven bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California’s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii).\\nIn such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once\\nregarded as among the most stable industries in America.\\nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through\\na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior\\nperformance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely\\nbe required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that\\nutilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE’s\\nextensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some\\nyears from completion. Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the\\ncontinental United States.\\nWith this model employed by both private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on,\\neven if population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The “margin of safety”\\napproach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactory-\\nreturn pact has been broken in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such\\nruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground transmission may be\\nrequired but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay the staggering costs for such construction?\\n13\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"zBVXzkgXrNAUQnMWvq6lSx+01FNfYP/+U167HhIE7i4=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_13":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"At Berkshire, we have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred.\\nThese costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have increased – and will likely\\ncontinue to increase – if convective storms become more frequent.\\nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s forest-fire losses and can\\nintelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western\\nstates. It remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere.\\nOther electric utilities may face survival problems resembling those of Pacific Gas and\\nElectric and Hawaiian Electric. A confiscatory resolution of our present problems would obviously\\nbe a negative for BHE, but both that company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive\\nnegative surprises. We regularly get these in our insurance business, where our basic product is\\nrisk assumption, and they will occur elsewhere. Berkshire can sustain financial surprises but we\\nwill not knowingly throw good money after bad.\\nWhatever the case at Berkshire, the final result for the utility industry may be ominous:\\nCertain utilities might no longer attract the savings of American citizens and will be forced to\\nadopt the public-power model.

The industry’s accounting is designed to\\nrecognize this reality, but estimation mistakes can be huge. And when charlatans are involved,\\ndetection is often both slow and costly.

Let’s dig deeper.\\nGreg Abel, who runs all non-insurance operations for Berkshire – and in all respects is\\nready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow – was born and raised in Canada (he still plays hockey).\\nIn the 1990s, however, Greg lived for six years in Omaha just a few blocks away from me.

Both Ajit and his\\nwife, Tinku, have many Omaha friends, though it’s been more than three decades since they moved\\nto New York (in order to be where much of the action in reinsurance takes place).\\nMissing from the stage this year will be Charlie. He and I were both born in Omaha about\\ntwo miles from where you will sit at our May get-together. In his first ten years, Charlie lived\\nabout a half-mile from where Berkshire has long maintained its office. Both Charlie and I spent\\nour early years in Omaha public schools and were indelibly shaped by our Omaha childhood. We\\ndidn’t meet, however, until much later. (A footnote that may surprise you: Charlie lived under 15\\nof America’s 45 presidents.

Consequently, it was not until 1959 when he was 35 that I first met him.\\nIn 1962, he decided that he should take up money management.\\nThree years later he told me – correctly! – that I had made a dumb decision in\\nbuying control of Berkshire. But, he assured me, since I had already made the move,\\nhe would tell me how to correct my mistake.\\nIn what I next relate, bear in mind that Charlie and his family did not have a\\ndime invested in the small investing partnership that I was then managing and whose\\nmoney I had used for the Berkshire purchase. Moreover, neither of us expected that\\nCharlie would ever own a share of Berkshire stock.\\nNevertheless, Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: “Warren, forget about\\never buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add\\nto it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses\\nat wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero,\\nBen Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.” With much back-sliding\\nI subsequently followed his instructions.\\nMany years later, Charlie became my partner in running Berkshire and,\\nrepeatedly, jerked me back to sanity when my old habits surfaced. Until his death, he\\ncontinued in this role and together we, along with those who early on invested with\\nus, ended up far better off than Charlie and I had ever dreamed possible.\\nIn reality, Charlie was the “architect” of the present Berkshire, and I acted as\\nthe “general contractor” to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision.\\nCharlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me\\ntake the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part\\nolder brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the\\nreins, and when I blundered he never – never –reminded me of my mistake.\\nIn the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those\\nwho had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten. Berkshire\\nhas become a great company. Though I have long been in charge of the construction\\ncrew; Charlie should forever be credited with being the architect.\\n2\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2412,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"5e373Fv5SBTm95f9bD3vaNH5PbVbbPBtUmC22nUYVmQ=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ccef39bc-9e17-44e6-b143-a43ade435a31":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ccef39bc-9e17-44e6-b143-a43ade435a31\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"tPs1LBUoNml4EETdHTs5FDY7kKyU68xFcCgH55Q6c6g=\"}},\"text\":\"BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\\nBerkshire has more than three million shareholder accounts.

He and\\nI were of one mind regarding our responsibilities to Berkshire shareholders.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nWriters find it useful to picture the reader they seek, and often they are hoping to attract a\\nmass audience. At Berkshire, we have a more limited target: investors who trust Berkshire with\\ntheir savings without any expectation of resale (resembling in attitude people who save in order to\\nbuy a farm or rental property rather than people who prefer using their excess funds to purchase\\nlottery tickets or “hot” stocks).\\nOver the years, Berkshire has attracted an unusual number of such “lifetime” shareholders\\nand their heirs.

Let me introduce her.\\nFor openers, Bertie is smart, wise and likes to challenge my thinking. We have never,\\nhowever, had a shouting match or anything close to a ruptured relationship.

She follows business news – reading four newspapers daily – but doesn’t consider\\nherself an economic expert. She is sensible – very sensible – instinctively knowing that pundits\\nshould always be ignored. After all, if she could reliably predict tomorrow’s winners, would she\\nfreely share her valuable insights and thereby increase competitive buying? That would be like\\nfinding gold and then handing a map to the neighbors showing its location.\\nBertie understands the power – for good or bad – of incentives, the weaknesses of humans,\\nthe “tells” that can be recognized when observing human behavior. She knows who is “selling”\\nand who can be trusted. In short, she is nobody’s fool.\\nSo, what would interest Bertie this year?\\nOperating Results, Fact and Fiction\\nLet’s begin with the numbers. The official annual report begins on K-1 and extends for 124\\npages. It is filled with a vast amount of information – some important, some trivial.\\nAmong its disclosures many owners, along with financial reporters, will focus on page\\nK-72. There, they will find the proverbial “bottom line” labeled “Net earnings (loss).” The\\nnumbers read $90 billion for 2021, ($23 billion) for 2022 and $96 billion for 2023.\\nWhat in the world is going on?\\nYou seek guidance and are told that the procedures for calculating these “earnings” are\\npromulgated by a sober and credentialed Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”),\\nmandated by a dedicated and hard-working Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and\\naudited by the world-class professionals at Deloitte & Touche (“D&T”). On page K-67, D&T pulls\\nno punches: “In our opinion, the financial statements . . . . . present fairly, in all material respects\\n(italics mine), the financial position of the Company . . . . . and the results of its operations . . . . .\\nfor each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 . . . . .”\\nSo sanctified, this worse-than-useless “net income” figure quickly gets transmitted\\nthroughout the world via the internet and media. All parties believe they have done their job – and,\\nlegally, they have.\\nWe, however, are left uncomfortable. At Berkshire, our view is that “earnings” should be a\\nsensible concept that Bertie will find somewhat useful – but only as a starting point – in\\nevaluating a business. Accordingly, Berkshire also reports to Bertie and you what we call\\n“operating earnings.” Here is the story they tell: $27.6 billion for 2021; $30.9 billion for 2022 and\\n$37.4 billion for 2023.\\n4\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2582,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"+f1tDMrpzSrmAV9YslOurZD32ew46DEUkrNsoe6yGdQ=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2f2a4b3f-6cf4-4fb3-a2ec-36ce3cc25384":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2f2a4b3f-6cf4-4fb3-a2ec-36ce3cc25384\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":4,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_4\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":4,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"+BoBJ+JaMgLYRTeH33GgTyDl8qCNkMFS+shfTsYyXas=\"}},\"text\":\"The primary difference between the mandated figures and the ones Berkshire prefers is that\\nwe exclude unrealized capital gains or losses that at times can exceed $5 billion a day.

And so far, so good.\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 100 on that fateful day in 1942 when I “pulled the\\ntrigger.” I was down about $5 by the time school was out. Soon, things turned around and now that\\nindex hovers around 38,000. America has been a terrific country for investors. All they have\\nneeded to do is sit quietly, listening to no one.\\nIt is more than silly, however, to make judgments about Berkshire’s investment value based\\non “earnings” that incorporate the capricious day-by-day and, yes, even year-by-year movements\\nof the stock market. As Ben Graham taught me, “In the short run the market acts as a voting\\nmachine; in the long run it becomes a weighing machine.”\\nWhat We Do\\nOur goal at Berkshire is simple: We want to own either all or a portion of businesses that\\nenjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring. Within capitalism, some businesses will\\nflourish for a very long time while others will prove to be sinkholes. It’s harder than you would\\nthink to predict which will be the winners and losers. And those who tell you they know the answer\\nare usually either self-delusional or snake-oil salesmen.\\nAt Berkshire, we particularly favor the rare enterprise that can deploy additional capital at\\nhigh returns in the future. Owning only one of these companies – and simply sitting tight – can\\ndeliver wealth almost beyond measure. Even heirs to such a holding can – ugh! – sometimes live\\na lifetime of leisure.\\nWe also hope these favored businesses are run by able and trustworthy managers, though\\nthat is a more difficult judgment to make, however, and Berkshire has had its share\\nof disappointments.\\n5\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2600,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"gpWVI0/7J8zlruDKd0xKWwDzK0Ug6tbMrCLRIAH0JUE=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ac713959-3470-4b8f-b10e-ee105a2bddd9":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ac713959-3470-4b8f-b10e-ee105a2bddd9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"RwlMZxG7SrSs240EPMu+8vQ3KPwWnMj+Qsd8HM8EfcE=\"}},\"text\":\"In 1863, Hugh McCulloch, the first Comptroller of the United States, sent a letter to all\\nnational banks.

It is clearly the most efficient\\nway – measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity – of moving heavy materials to distant\\ndestinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must travel to\\ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can’t run without\\nrail, and the industry’s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American\\nbusinesses, railroads eat capital.\\nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad\\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted\\nother fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least\\n$500 billion to replicate those assets and decades to complete the job.\\nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain its present\\nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested,\\nbut it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries.\\nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years\\nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $1 1⁄2 billion annually. Ouch! That sort of\\ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall considerably short of\\nBNSF’s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad’s debt. And that we do not\\nintend to do.\\nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less\\nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That’s no\\nsurprise to me or Berkshire’s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a\\nsmall fraction of its replacement value.\\nNorth America’s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and\\nexported goods, etc. one-way for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for\\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization\\nof track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I\\nsit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees\\nworking under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions.\\nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the\\ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must\\ndeal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or\\nmentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car,\\nextraordinarily heavy train that can’t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be\\nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more\\ncommon in Europe and will always be with us.\\n12\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3108,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"shkCItvHp+ukOIBBB6gSY33myRGBwN2/NcyCIUaXok0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"34355c3c-8d76-41d1-b050-62ef8556a987":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"34355c3c-8d76-41d1-b050-62ef8556a987\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_12\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"zBVXzkgXrNAUQnMWvq6lSx+01FNfYP/+U167HhIE7i4=\"}},\"text\":\"Wage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and\\nCongress. Additionally, American railroads are required to carry many dangerous products every\\nday that the industry would much rather avoid. The words “common carrier” define\\nrailroad responsibilities.\\nLast year BNSF’s earnings declined more than I expected, as revenues fell. Though fuel\\ncosts also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country’s inflation\\ngoals. This differential may recur in future negotiations.\\nThough BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five\\nsince our purchase. I believe that our vast service territory is second to none and that therefore our\\nmargin comparisons can and should improve.\\nI am particularly proud of both BNSF’s contribution to the country and the people who\\nwork in sub-zero outdoor jobs in North Dakota and Montana winters to keep America’s\\ncommercial arteries open. Railroads don’t get much attention when they are working but, were\\nthey unavailable, the void would be noticed immediately throughout America.\\nA century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of\\nBerkshire. You can count on that.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last year occurred at BHE. Most\\nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as\\nexpected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or\\neven bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California’s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii).\\nIn such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once\\nregarded as among the most stable industries in America.\\nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through\\na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior\\nperformance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely\\nbe required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that\\nutilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE’s\\nextensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some\\nyears from completion. Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the\\ncontinental United States.\\nWith this model employed by both private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on,\\neven if population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The “margin of safety”\\napproach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactory-\\nreturn pact has been broken in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such\\nruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground transmission may be\\nrequired but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay the staggering costs for such construction?\\n13\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3148,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"RvTcfNzUDqeD86qTZL7qxoC1BWChoTbV361/y2Uw0Xo=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4612604d-079e-4f59-8033-1e6c9eccfc46":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4612604d-079e-4f59-8033-1e6c9eccfc46\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"mu7RmsFnz9Ah40p1OKQl4pjdCui0xQAAdyHFkGybfIc=\"}},\"text\":\"At Berkshire, we have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred.\\nThese costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have increased – and will likely\\ncontinue to increase – if convective storms become more frequent.\\nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s forest-fire losses and can\\nintelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western\\nstates. It remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere.\\nOther electric utilities may face survival problems resembling those of Pacific Gas and\\nElectric and Hawaiian Electric. A confiscatory resolution of our present problems would obviously\\nbe a negative for BHE, but both that company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive\\nnegative surprises. We regularly get these in our insurance business, where our basic product is\\nrisk assumption, and they will occur elsewhere. Berkshire can sustain financial surprises but we\\nwill not knowingly throw good money after bad.\\nWhatever the case at Berkshire, the final result for the utility industry may be ominous:\\nCertain utilities might no longer attract the savings of American citizens and will be forced to\\nadopt the public-power model. Nebraska made this choice in the 1930s and there are many\\npublic-power operations throughout the country. Eventually, voters, taxpayers and users will\\ndecide which model they prefer.\\nWhen the dust settles, America’s power needs and the consequent capital expenditure will\\nbe staggering. I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns\\nand, along with Berkshire’s two partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nEnough about problems: Our insurance business performed exceptionally well last year,\\nsetting records in sales, float and underwriting profits. Property-casualty insurance (“P/C”)\\nprovides the core of Berkshire’s well-being and growth. We have been in the business for 57 years\\nand despite our nearly 5,000-fold increase in volume – from $17 million to $83 billion – we have\\nmuch room to grow.\\nBeyond that, we have learned – too often, painfully – a good deal about what types of\\ninsurance business and what sort of people to avoid. The most important lesson is that our\\nunderwriters can be thin, fat, male, female, young, old, foreign or domestic. But they can’t be\\noptimists at the office, however desirable that quality may generally be in life.\\nSurprises in the P/C business – which can occur decades after six-month or one-year\\npolicies have expired – are almost always negative. The industry’s accounting is designed to\\nrecognize this reality, but estimation mistakes can be huge. And when charlatans are involved,\\ndetection is often both slow and costly. Berkshire will always attempt to be accurate in its estimates\\nof future loss payments but inflation – both monetary and the “legal” variety – is a wild card.\\n14\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2972,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"aX1x8VEmUQnIz+za6sH6umCzUYO0MMoN6VcC/RAr9jY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a9b79b0b-79ea-4c2c-8956-ac4d0d640f6f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a9b79b0b-79ea-4c2c-8956-ac4d0d640f6f\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_14\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"xWKEmaCWkK3pz4bOsUDpKL8v6/DCgWic6c+IbceOlVo=\"}},\"text\":\"I’ve told the story of our insurance operations so many times that I will simply direct\\nnewcomers to page 18.

Before that lucky day – aside from an almost unbelievably\\nwonderful experience with GEICO that began early in 1951 and will never end – I was largely\\nwandering in the wilderness, as I struggled to build our insurance operation.\\nAjit’s achievements since joining Berkshire have been supported by a large cast of\\nhugely-talented insurance executives in our various P/C operations. Their names and faces are\\nunknown to most of the press and the public.

On stage you will see the three\\nmanagers who now bear the prime responsibilities for steering your company. What, you may\\nwonder, do the three have in common? They certainly don’t look alike. Let’s dig deeper.\\nGreg Abel, who runs all non-insurance operations for Berkshire – and in all respects is\\nready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow – was born and raised in Canada (he still plays hockey).\\nIn the 1990s, however, Greg lived for six years in Omaha just a few blocks away from me. During\\nthat period, I never met him.\\nA decade or so earlier, Ajit Jain, who was born, raised and educated in India, lived with his\\nfamily in Omaha only a mile or so from my home (where I’ve lived since 1958). Both Ajit and his\\nwife, Tinku, have many Omaha friends, though it’s been more than three decades since they moved\\nto New York (in order to be where much of the action in reinsurance takes place).\\nMissing from the stage this year will be Charlie. He and I were both born in Omaha about\\ntwo miles from where you will sit at our May get-together. In his first ten years, Charlie lived\\nabout a half-mile from where Berkshire has long maintained its office. Both Charlie and I spent\\nour early years in Omaha public schools and were indelibly shaped by our Omaha childhood. We\\ndidn’t meet, however, until much later. (A footnote that may surprise you: Charlie lived under 15\\nof America’s 45 presidents. People refer to President Biden as #46, but that numbering counts\\nGrover Cleveland as both #22 and #24 because his terms were not consecutive.

Its introduction to Europe began in 1782 when a French\\nJesuit Father living in China, Joseph Amiot, acquired a copy of it, and translated it into\\nFrench. It was not a good translation because, according to Dr. Giles, \\\"[I]t contains a\\ngreat deal that Sun Tzu did not write, and very little indeed of what he did.\\\"\\nThe first translation into English was published in 1905 in Tokyo by Capt. E. F.\\nCalthrop, R.F.A. However, this translation is, in the words of Dr. Giles, \\\"excessively\\nbad.\\\" He goes further in this criticism: \\\"It is not merely a question of downright blun-\\nders, from which none can hope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent; hard\\npassages were willfully distorted or slurred over. Such offenses are less pardonable.\\nThey would not be tolerated in any edition of a Latin or Greek classic, and a similar\\nstandard of honesty ought to be insisted upon in translations from Chinese.\\\" In 1908\\na new edition of Capt. Calthrop’s translation was published in London. It was an im-\\nprovement on the first – omissions filled up and numerous mistakes corrected – but\\nnew errors were created in the process. Dr. Giles, in justifying his translation, wrote:\\n\\\"It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate of my own powers; but I could not\\nhelp feeling that Sun Tzu deserved a better fate than had befallen him, and I knew that,\\nat any rate, I could hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors.\\\"\\nClearly, Dr. Giles’ work established much of the groundwork for the work of later\\ntranslators who published their own editions. Of the later editions of the ART OF WAR\\nI have examined; two feature Giles’ edited translation and notes, the other two present\\nthe same basic information from the ancient Chinese commentators found in the Giles\\nedition. Of these four, Giles’ 1910 edition is the most scholarly and presents the reader\\nan incredible amount of information concerning Sun Tzu’s text, much more than any\\nother translation.\\nThe Giles’ edition of the ART OF WAR, as stated above, was a scholarly work.\\nDr. Giles was a leading sinologue at the time and an assistant in the Department of\\nOriental Printed Books and Manuscripts in the British Museum. Apparently he wanted\\nto produce a definitive edition, superior to anything else that existed and perhaps some-\\nthing that would become a standard translation. It was the best translation available for\\n50 years. But apparently there was not much interest in Sun Tzu in English- speaking\\ncountries since it took the start of the Second World War to renew interest in his work.\\nSeveral people published unsatisfactory English translations of Sun Tzu. In 1944, Dr.\\nGiles’ translation was edited and published in the United States in a series of military\\nscience books. But it wasn’t until 1963 that a good English translation (by Samuel B.\\nGriffith and still in print) was published that was an equal to Giles’ translation. While\\nthis translation is more lucid than Dr. Giles’ translation, it lacks his copious notes that\\nmake his so interesting.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"D0p0aw/iKIgeO7wq12H/0caSnznc2Tla9ZgkQnmX5PQ=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"CONTENTS 4\\nDr. Giles produced a work primarily intended for scholars of the Chinese civiliza-\\ntion and language. It contains the Chinese text of Sun Tzu, the English translation, and\\nvoluminous notes along with numerous footnotes. Unfortunately, some of his notes and\\nfootnotes contain Chinese characters; some are completely Chinese. Thus, a conver-\\nsion to a Latin alphabet etext was difficult. I did the conversion in complete ignorance\\nof Chinese (except for what I learned while doing the conversion). Thus, I faced the\\ndifficult task of paraphrasing it while retaining as much of the important text as I could.\\nEvery paraphrase represents a loss; thus I did what I could to retain as much of the text\\nas possible. Because the 1910 text contains a Chinese concordance, I was able to trans-\\nliterate proper names, books, and the like at the risk of making the text more obscure.\\nHowever, the text, on the whole, is quite satisfactory for the casual reader, a transform-\\nation made possible by conversion to an etext. However, I come away from this task\\nwith the feeling of loss because I know that someone with a background in Chinese\\ncan do a better job than I did; any such attempt would be welcomed.\\nBob Sutton\\nal876@cleveland.freenet.edu\\nbobs@gnu.ai.mit.edu\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"CuCyFAgqy0MiC12tTvSHyRl+cG3yun7bf3NrXWFuOZs=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_6\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":6,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Chapter 1\\nINTRODUCTION\\n1.1 Sun Wu and his Book\\nSsu-ma Ch‘ien gives the following biography of Sun Tzu:1\\nSun Tzu Wu was a native of the Ch‘i State.

Sun Tzu: \\\"If\\nwords of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly\\nunderstood, the general is to blame. But if his orders ARE clear, and the\\nsoldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers.\\\"\\nSo saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be beheaded.\\nNow the king of Wu was watching the scene from the top of a raised\\npavilion; and when he saw that his favorite concubines were about to be\\nexecuted, he was greatly alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following\\nmessage: \\\"We are now quite satisfied as to our general’s ability to handle\\ntroops. If We are bereft of these two concubines, our meat and drink will\\nlose their savor. It is our wish that they shall not be beheaded.\\\"\\nSun Tzu replied: \\\"Having once received His Majesty’s commission to\\nbe the general of his forces, there are certain commands of His Majesty\\nwhich, acting in that capacity, I am unable to accept.\\\"\\nAccordingly, he had the two leaders beheaded, and straightway installed\\nthe pair next in order as leaders in their place. When this had been done,\\nthe drum was sounded for the drill once more; and the girls went through\\nall the evolutions, turning to the right or to the left, marching ahead or\\nwheeling back, kneeling or standing, with perfect accuracy and precision,\\nnot venturing to utter a sound. Then Sun Tzu sent a messenger to the King\\nsaying: \\\"Your soldiers, Sire, are now properly drilled and disciplined, and\\nready for your majesty’s inspection. They can be put to any use that their\\nsovereign may desire; bid them go through fire and water, and they will\\nnot disobey.\\\"\\nBut the King replied: \\\"Let our general cease drilling and return to camp.\\nAs for us, We have no wish to come down and inspect the troops.\\\"\\nThereupon Sun Tzu said: \\\"The King is only fond of words, and cannot\\ntranslate them into deeds.\\\"\\nAfter that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tzu was one who knew how to handle an\\narmy, and finally appointed him general. In the west, he defeated the Ch‘u\\nState and forced his way into Ying, the capital; to the north he put fear\\ninto the States of Ch‘i and Chin, and spread his fame abroad amongst the\\nfeudal princes. And Sun Tzu shared in the might of the King.\\nAbout Sun Tzu himself this is all that Ssu-ma Ch‘ien has to tell us in this chapter. But\\nhe proceeds to give a biography of his descendant, Sun Pin, born about a hundred years\\nafter his famous ancestor’s death, and also the outstanding military genius of his time.\\nThe historian speaks of him too as Sun Tzu, and in his preface we read: \\\"Sun Tzu\\nhad his feet cut off and yet continued to discuss the art of war.\\\"3 It seems likely, then,\\nthat \\\"Pin\\\" was a nickname bestowed on him after his mutilation, unless the story was\\ninvented in order to account for the name.

INTRODUCTION 7\\ncrushing defeat of his treacherous rival P‘ang Chuan, will be found briefly related in\\nChapter V. ss. 19, note.\\nTo return to the elder Sun Tzu. He is mentioned in two other passages of the SHIH\\nCHI:\\nIn the third year of his reign [512 B.C.] Ho Lu, king of Wu, took the\\nfield with Tzu-hsu [i.e. Wu Yuan] and Po P‘ei, and attacked Ch‘u. He\\ncaptured the town of Shu and slew the two prince’s sons who had formerly\\nbeen generals of Wu. He was then meditating a descent on Ying [the\\ncapital]; but the general Sun Wu said: \\\"The army is exhausted. It is not\\nyet possible. We must wait\\\".... [After further successful fighting,] \\\"in the\\nninth year [506 B.C.], King Ho Lu addressed Wu Tzu-hsu and Sun Wu,\\nsaying: \\\"Formerly, you declared that it was not yet possible for us to enter\\nYing. Is the time ripe now?\\\" The two men replied: \\\"Ch‘u’s general Tzu-\\nch‘ang, 4 is grasping and covetous, and the princes of T‘ang and Ts‘ai both\\nhave a grudge against him. If Your Majesty has resolved to make a grand\\nattack, you must win over T‘ang and Ts‘ai, and then you may succeed.\\\"\\nHo Lu followed this advice, [beat Ch‘u in five pitched battles and marched\\ninto Ying.]5\\nThis is the latest date at which anything is recorded of Sun Wu. He does not appear to\\nhave survived his patron, who died from the effects of a wound in 496.\\nIn another chapter there occurs this passage:6\\nFrom this time onward, a number of famous soldiers arose, one after the\\nother: Kao-fan,7 who was employed by the Chin State; Wang-tzu,8 in the\\nservice of Ch‘i; and Sun Wu, in the service of Wu. These men developed\\nand threw light upon the principles of war.\\nIt is obvious enough that Ssu-ma Ch‘ien at least had no doubt about the reality of Sun\\nWu as an historical personage; and with one exception, to be noticed presently, he is\\nby far the most important authority on the period in question. It will not be necessary,\\ntherefore, to say much of such a work as the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU, which is\\nsupposed to have been written by Chao Yeh of the 1st century A.D. The attribution is\\nsomewhat doubtful; but even if it were otherwise, his account would be of little value,\\nbased as it is on the SHIH CHI and expanded with romantic details. The story of Sun\\nTzu will be found, for what it is worth, in chapter 2. The only new points in it worth\\nnoting are: (1) Sun Tzu was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu Tzu-hsu. (2) He is\\ncalled a native of Wu. (3) He had previously lived a retired life, and his contemporaries\\nwere unaware of his ability.\\nThe following passage occurs in the Huai-nan Tzu: \\\"When sovereign and ministers\\nshow perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tzu to encounter the foe.\\\"\\n4The appellation of Nang Wa.\\n5SHI CHI, ch. 31.\\n6SHI CHI, ch. 25.\\n7The appellation of Hu Yen, mentioned in ch. 39 under the year 637.\\n8Wang-tzu Ch‘eng-fu, ch. 32, year 607.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"hkqt8bcUw/9t286VmpmXdFDhctTcNHuMNOU3MO3wRSo=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_9":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 8\\nAssuming that this work is genuine (and hitherto no doubt has been cast upon it), we\\nhave here the earliest direct reference for Sun Tzu, for Huai-nan Tzu died in 122 B.C.,\\nmany years before the SHIH CHI was given to the world.\\nLiu Hsiang (80-9 B.C.) says: \\\"The reason why Sun Tzu at the head of 30,000 men\\nbeat Ch‘u with 200,000 is that the latter were undisciplined.\\\"\\nTeng Ming-shih informs us that the surname \\\"Sun\\\" was bestowed on Sun Wu’s\\ngrandfather by Duke Ching of Ch‘i [547-490 B.C.]. Sun Wu’s father Sun P‘ing, rose\\nto be a Minister of State in Ch‘i, and Sun Wu himself, whose style was Ch‘ang-ch‘ing,\\nfled to Wu on account of the rebellion which was being fomented by the kindred of\\nT‘ien Pao. He had three sons, of whom the second, named Ming, was the father of Sun\\nPin. According to this account then, Pin was the grandson of Wu, which, considering\\nthat Sun Pin’s victory over Wei was gained in 341 B.C., may be dismissed as chronolo-\\ngical impossible. Whence these data were obtained by Teng Ming-shih I do not know,\\nbut of course no reliance whatever can be placed in them.\\nAn interesting document which has survived from the close of the Han period is\\nthe short preface written by the Great Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, or Wei Wu Ti, for his edition of Sun\\nTzu. I shall give it in full:\\nI have heard that the ancients used bows and arrows to their advantage.9\\nThe SHU CHU mentions \\\"the army\\\" among the \\\"eight objects of gov-\\nernment.\\\" The I CHING says: \\\"’army’ indicates firmness and justice; the\\nexperienced leader will have good fortune.\\\" The SHIH CHING says: \\\"The\\nKing rose majestic in his wrath, and he marshaled his troops.\\\" The Yellow\\nEmperor, T‘ang the Completer and Wu Wang all used spears and battle-\\naxes in order to succor their generation. The SSU-MA FA says: \\\"If one\\nman slay another of set purpose, he himself may rightfully be slain.\\\" He\\nwho relies solely on warlike measures shall be exterminated; he who relies\\nsolely on peaceful measures shall perish. Instances of this are Fu Ch‘ai10\\non the one hand and Yen Wang on the other. 11 In military matters, the\\nSage’s rule is normally to keep the peace, and to move his forces only\\nwhen occasion requires. He will not use armed force unless driven to it by\\nnecessity.\\nMany books have I read on the subject of war and fighting; but the work\\ncomposed by Sun Wu is the profoundest of them all. [Sun Tzu was a\\nnative of the Ch‘i state, his personal name was Wu. He wrote the ART\\nOF WAR in 13 chapters for Ho Lu, King of Wu. Its principles were tested\\non women, and he was subsequently made a general. He led an army\\nwestwards, crushed the Ch‘u state and entered Ying the capital. In the\\nnorth, he kept Ch‘i and Chin in awe. A hundred years and more after his\\n9\\\"They attached strings to wood to make bows, and sharpened wood to make arrows.

INTRODUCTION 9\\ntime, Sun Pin lived. He was a descendant of Wu.] 12 In his treatment of\\ndeliberation and planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the field, 13\\nclearness of conception, and depth of design, Sun Tzu stands beyond the\\nreach of carping criticism. My contemporaries, however, have failed to\\ngrasp the full meaning of his instructions, and while putting into practice\\nthe smaller details in which his work abounds, they have overlooked its\\nessential purport. That is the motive which has led me to outline a rough\\nexplanation of the whole.\\nOne thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit statement that the 13 chapters were\\nspecially composed for King Ho Lu. This is supported by the internal evidence of I. ss.\\n15, in which it seems clear that some ruler is addressed.\\nIn the bibliographic section of the HAN SHU, there is an entry which has given\\nrise to much discussion: \\\"The works of Sun Tzu of Wu in 82 P‘IEN (or chapters), with\\ndiagrams in 9 CHUAN.\\\" It is evident that this cannot be merely the 13 chapters known\\nto Ssu-ma Ch‘ien, or those we possess today. Chang Shou-chieh refers to an edition\\nof Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR of which the \\\"13 chapters\\\" formed the first CHUAN,\\nadding that there were two other CHUAN besides. This has brought forth a theory, that\\nthe bulk of these 82 chapters consisted of other writings of Sun Tzu – we should call\\nthem apocryphal – similar to the WEN TA, of which a specimen dealing with the Nine\\nSituations14 is preserved in the T‘UNG TIEN, and another in Ho Shin’s commentary.\\nIt is suggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzu had only written the\\n13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of question and\\nanswer between himself and the King. Pi I-hsun, the author of the SUN TZU HSU\\nLU, backs this up with a quotation from the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU: \\\"The King of\\nWu summoned Sun Tzu, and asked him questions about the art of war. Each time he\\nset forth a chapter of his work, the King could not find words enough to praise him.\\\"\\nAs he points out, if the whole work was expounded on the same scale as in the above-\\nmentioned fragments, the total number of chapters could not fail to be considerable.\\nThen the numerous other treatises attributed to Sun Tzu might be included. The fact\\nthat the HAN CHIH mentions no work of Sun Tzu except the 82 P‘IEN, whereas the\\nSui and T‘ang bibliographies give the titles of others in addition to the \\\"13 chapters,\\\" is\\ngood proof, Pi I-hsun thinks, that all of these were contained in the 82 P‘IEN. Without\\npinning our faith to the accuracy of details supplied by the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU,\\nor admitting the genuineness of any of the treatises cited by Pi I-hsun, we may see in\\nthis theory a probable solution of the mystery. Between Ssu-ma Ch‘ien and Pan Ku\\nthere was plenty of time for a luxuriant crop of forgeries to have grown up under the\\nmagic name of Sun Tzu, and the 82 P‘IEN may very well represent a collected edition\\nof these lumped together with the original work. It is also possible, though less likely,\\nthat some of them existed in the time of the earlier historian and were purposely ignored\\nby him.15\\n12The passage I have put in brackets is omitted in the T‘U SHU, and may be an interpolation. It was\\nknown, however to Chang Shou-chieh of the T‘ang dynasty, and appears in the T‘AI P‘ING YU LAN.\\n13Ts‘ao Kung seems to be thinking of the first part of chap.

This, as Sun Hsing-yen points\\nout, is only a modest way of saying that he made an explanatory paraphrase, or in other\\nwords, wrote a commentary on it. On the whole, this theory has met with very little\\nacceptance. Thus, the SSU K‘U CH‘UAN SHU says: \\\"The mention of the 13 chapters\\nin the SHIH CHI shows that they were in existence before the HAN CHIH, and that\\nlatter accretions are not to be considered part of the original work. Tu Mu’s assertion\\ncan certainly not be taken as proof.\\\"\\nThere is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters existed in the time of\\nSsu-ma Ch‘ien practically as we have them now. That the work was then well known\\nhe tells us in so many words. \\\"Sun Tzu’s 13 Chapters and Wu Ch‘i’s Art of War are the\\ntwo books that people commonly refer to on the subject of military matters. Both of\\nthem are widely distributed, so I will not discuss them here.\\\" But as we go further back,\\nserious difficulties begin to arise. The salient fact which has to be faced is that the TSO\\nCHUAN, the greatest contemporary record, makes no mention whatsoever of Sun Wu,\\neither as a general or as a writer. It is natural, in view of this awkward circumstance,\\nthat many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story of Sun Wu as given in the\\nSHIH CHI, but even show themselves frankly skeptical as to the existence of the man\\nat all. The most powerful presentment of this side of the case is to be found in the\\nfollowing disposition by Yeh Shui-hsin:16\\nIt is stated in Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s history that Sun Wu was a native of the Ch‘i\\nState, and employed by Wu; and that in the reign of Ho Lu he crushed\\nCh‘u, entered Ying, and was a great general. But in Tso’s Commentary no\\nSun Wu appears at all. It is true that Tso’s Commentary need not contain\\nabsolutely everything that other histories contain. But Tso has not omitted\\nto mention vulgar plebeians and hireling ruffians such as Ying K‘ao-shu,17\\nTs‘ao Kuei,18, Chu Chih-wu and Chuan She-chu19. In the case of Sun\\nWu, whose fame and achievements were so brilliant, the omission is much\\nmore glaring. Again, details are given, in their due order, about his con-\\ntemporaries Wu Yuan and the Minister P‘ei.20 Is it credible that Sun Wu\\nalone should have been passed over?\\nIn point of literary style, Sun Tzu’s work belongs to the same school as\\nKUAN TZU,21 LIU T‘AO,22 and the YUEH YU23 and may have been the\\nproduction of some private scholar living towards the end of the \\\"Spring\\nthe case of very short works, one is tempted to think that P‘IEN might simply mean \\\"leaves.\\\"\\n16Yeh Shih of the Sung dynasty [1151-1223].\\n17He hardly deserves to be bracketed with assassins.\\n18See Chapter 7, ss. 27 and Chapter 11, ss. 28.\\n19See Chapter 11, ss. 28.

The former lived only a century after the\\nalleged date of Sun Tzu, and his death is known to have taken place in 381 B.C. It was\\nto him, according to Liu Hsiang, that Tseng Shen delivered the TSO CHUAN, which\\nhad been entrusted to him by its author.28 Now the fact that quotations from the ART\\nOF WAR, acknowledged or otherwise, are to be found in so many authors of differ-\\nent epochs, establishes a very strong anterior to them all, – in other words, that Sun\\nTzu’s treatise was already in existence towards the end of the 5th century B.C. Further\\nproof of Sun Tzu’s antiquity is furnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings\\nattaching to a number of the words he uses. A list of these, which might perhaps be\\nextended, is given in the HSU LU; and though some of the interpretations are doubtful,\\nthe main argument is hardly affected thereby. Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh\\nShui- hsin, a scholar and critic of the first rank, deliberately pronounces the style of the\\n13 chapters to belong to the early part of the fifth century. Seeing that he is actually\\nengaged in an attempt to disprove the existence of Sun Wu himself, we may be sure that\\nhe would not have hesitated to assign the work to a later date had he not honestly be-\\nlieved the contrary. And it is precisely on such a point that the judgment of an educated\\nChinaman will carry most weight. Other internal evidence is not far to seek. Thus in\\nXIII. ss. 1, there is an unmistakable allusion to the ancient system of land-tenure which\\nhad already passed away by the time of Mencius, who was anxious to see it revived in\\na modified form.29 The only warfare Sun Tzu knows is that carried on between the\\nvarious feudal princes, in which armored chariots play a large part. Their use seems to\\nhave entirely died out before the end of the Chou dynasty. He speaks as a man of Wu,\\na state which ceased to exist as early as 473 B.C. On this I shall touch presently.\\nBut once refer the work to the 5th century or earlier, and the chances of its being\\nother than a bona fide production are sensibly diminished. The great age of forgeries\\ndid not come until long after. That it should have been forged in the period immedi-\\nately following 473 is particularly unlikely, for no one, as a rule, hastens to identify\\nhimself with a lost cause. As for Yeh Shui-hsin’s theory, that the author was a literary\\nrecluse, that seems to me quite untenable. If one thing is more apparent than another\\nafter reading the maxims of Sun Tzu, it is that their essence has been distilled from\\na large store of personal observation and experience. They reflect the mind not only\\nof a born strategist, gifted with a rare faculty of generalization, but also of a practical\\nsoldier closely acquainted with the military conditions of his time. To say nothing of\\nthe fact that these sayings have been accepted and endorsed by all the greatest captains\\nof Chinese history, they offer a combination of freshness and sincerity, acuteness and\\ncommon sense, which quite excludes the idea that they were artificially concocted in\\nthe study. If we admit, then, that the 13 chapters were the genuine production of a\\nmilitary man living towards the end of the \\\"CH‘UN CH‘IU\\\" period, are we not bound,\\nin spite of the silence of the TSO CHUAN, to accept Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s account in its\\nentirety?

There is still one grave, if not fatal, objec-\\ntion to the chronology involved in the story as told in the SHIH CHI, which, so far as I\\nam aware, nobody has yet pointed out. There are two passages in Sun Tzu in which he\\nalludes to contemporary affairs. The first in in VI. ss. 21:\\nThough according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in\\nnumber, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say\\nthen that victory can be achieved.\\nThe other is in XI. ss. 30:\\nAsked if an army can be made to imitate the SHUAI-JAN, I should answer,\\nYes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are\\ncrossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come\\nto each other’s assistance just as the left hand helps the right.\\nThese two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of composition.\\nThey assign the work to the period of the struggle between Wu and Yueh. So much\\nhas been observed by Pi I-hsun. But what has hitherto escaped notice is that they also\\nseriously impair the credibility of Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s narrative. As we have seen above,\\nthe first positive date given in connection with Sun Wu is 512 B.C. He is then spoken\\nof as a general, acting as confidential adviser to Ho Lu, so that his alleged introduction\\nto that monarch had already taken place, and of course the 13 chapters must have been\\nwritten earlier still. But at that time, and for several years after, down to the capture\\nof Ying in 506, Ch‘u and not Yueh, was the great hereditary enemy of Wu. The two\\nstates, Ch‘u and Wu, had been constantly at war for over half a century, 30 whereas the\\nfirst war between Wu and Yueh was waged only in 510, 31 and even then was no more\\nthan a short interlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with Ch‘u. Now\\nCh‘u is not mentioned in the 13 chapters at all. The natural inference is that they were\\nwritten at a time when Yueh had become the prime antagonist of Wu, that is, after Ch‘u\\nhad suffered the great humiliation of 506. At this point, a table of dates may be found\\nuseful.\\n30When Wu first appears in the CH‘UN CH‘IU in 584, it is already at variance with its powerful neighbor.\\nThe CH‘UN CH‘IU first mentions Yueh in 537, the TSO CHUAN in 601.\\n31This is explicitly stated in the TSO CHUAN, XXXII, 2.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"pFbLRq2hezNDKfvgI1g9BZA96+ePUKMCwQgrCp/Wmws=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_15":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_15\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

It seems rather to imply that, for the moment at\\nleast, the tide had turned against Wu, and that she was getting the worst of the struggle.\\nHence we may conclude that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which\\ndate Yueh does not appear to have scored any notable success against Wu. Ho Lu died\\nin 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must have been during the period\\n505-496, when there was a lull in the hostilities, Wu having presumably exhausted\\nby its supreme effort against Ch‘u. On the other hand, if we choose to disregard the\\ntradition connecting Sun Wu’s name with Ho Lu, it might equally well have seen the\\nlight between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period 482-473, when Yueh was once\\nagain becoming a very serious menace.32 We may feel fairly certain that the author,\\nwhoever he may have been, was not a man of any great eminence in his own day.\\nOn this point the negative testimony of the TSO CHUAN far outweighs any shred of\\nauthority still attaching to the SHIH CHI, if once its other facts are discredited. Sun\\nHsing-yen, however, makes a feeble attempt to explain the omission of his name from\\nthe great commentary. It was Wu Tzu-hsu, he says, who got all the credit of Sun Wu’s\\nexploits, because the latter (being an alien) was not rewarded with an office in the State.\\nHow then did the Sun Tzu legend originate? It may be that the growing celebrity\\nof the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown to its author. It was felt\\nto be only right and proper that one so well versed in the science of war should have\\nsolid achievements to his credit as well. Now the capture of Ying was undoubtedly the\\ngreatest feat of arms in Ho Lu’s reign; it made a deep and lasting impression on all the\\nsurrounding states, and raised Wu to the short-lived zenith of her power. Hence, what\\nmore natural, as time went on, than that the acknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu,\\nshould be popularly identified with that campaign, at first perhaps only in the sense that\\nhis brain conceived and planned it; afterwards, that it was actually carried out by him\\n32There is this to be said for the later period, that the feud would tend to grow more bitter after each\\nencounter, and thus more fully justify the language used in XI. ss. 30.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"dMiiNgBvAV+6QNBy48DAQFzVlxoQoBfyFHECNneFzv8=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_16":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_16\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":16,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 15\\nin conjunction with Wu Yuan,33 Po P‘ei and Fu Kai?\\nIt is obvious that any attempt to reconstruct even the outline of Sun Tzu’s life must\\nbe based almost wholly on conjecture. With this necessary proviso, I should say that he\\nprobably entered the service of Wu about the time of Ho Lu’s accession, and gathered\\nexperience, though only in the capacity of a subordinate officer, during the intense mil-\\nitary activity which marked the first half of the prince’s reign.34 If he rose to be a gen-\\neral at all, he certainly was never on an equal footing with the three above mentioned.\\nHe was doubtless present at the investment and occupation of Ying, and witnessed Wu’s\\nsudden collapse in the following year. Yueh’s attack at this critical juncture, when her\\nrival was embarrassed on every side, seems to have convinced him that this upstart\\nkingdom was the great enemy against whom every effort would henceforth have to be\\ndirected. Sun Wu was thus a well-seasoned warrior when he sat down to write his\\nfamous book, which according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the end,\\nrather than the beginning of Ho Lu’s reign. The story of the women may possibly have\\ngrown out of some real incident occurring about the same time. As we hear no more\\nof Sun Wu after this from any source, he is hardly likely to have survived his patron\\nor to have taken part in the death-struggle with Yueh, which began with the disaster at\\nTsuili.\\nIf these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain irony in the fate\\nwhich decreed that China’s most illustrious man of peace should be contemporary with\\nher greatest writer on war.\\n1.2 The Text of Sun Tzu\\nI have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzu’s text. The quo-\\ntations that occur in early authors go to show that the \\\"13 chapters\\\" of which Ssu-ma\\nCh‘ien speaks were essentially the same as those now extant. We have his word for it\\nthat they were widely circulated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from\\ndiscussing them on that account. Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface:\\nDuring the Ch‘in and Han dynasties Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR was in\\ngeneral use amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated\\nit as a work of mysterious import, and were unwilling to expound it for the\\nbenefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was the first to write\\na commentary on it.\\nAs we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that Ts‘ao Kung\\ntampered with the text. But the text itself is often so obscure, and the number of edi-\\ntions which appeared from that time onward so great, especially during the T‘ang and\\nSung dynasties, that it would be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed\\n33With Wu Yuan himself the case is just the reverse: – a spurious treatise on war has been fathered on him\\nsimply because he was a great general.

INTRODUCTION 16\\nto creep in. Towards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the chief com-\\nmentaries on Sun Tzu were in existence, a certain Chi T‘ien-pao published a work in\\n15 CHUAN entitled \\\"Sun Tzu with the collected commentaries of ten writers.\\\" There\\nwas another text, with variant readings put forward by Chu Fu of Ta-hsing, which also\\nhad supporters among the scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun Hsing-\\nyen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no longer put into circula-\\ntion. Thus, until the end of the 18th century, the text in sole possession of the field\\nwas one derived from Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition, although no actual copy of that import-\\nant work was known to have survived. That, therefore, is the text of Sun Tzu which\\nappears in the War section of the great Imperial encyclopedia printed in 1726, the KU\\nCHIN T‘U SHU CHI CH‘ENG. Another copy at my disposal of what is practically\\nthe same text, with slight variations, is that contained in the \\\"Eleven philosophers of\\nthe Chou and Ch‘in dynasties\\\" [1758]. And the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop’s\\nfirst edition is evidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese channels.\\nSo things remained until Sun Hsing-yen [1752-1818], a distinguished antiquarian and\\nclassical scholar, who claimed to be an actual descendant of Sun Wu,35 accidentally\\ndiscovered a copy of Chi T‘ien-pao’s long-lost work, when on a visit to the library\\nof the Hua-yin temple.36 Appended to it was the I SHUO of Cheng Yu-Hsien, men-\\ntioned in the T‘UNG CHIH, and also believed to have perished. This is what Sun\\nHsing-yen designates as the \\\"original edition (or text)\\\" – a rather misleading name, for\\nit cannot by any means claim to set before us the text of Sun Tzu in its pristine purity.\\nChi T‘ien-pao was a careless compiler, and appears to have been content to reproduce\\nthe somewhat debased version current in his day, without troubling to collate it with\\nthe earliest editions then available. Fortunately, two versions of Sun Tzu, even older\\nthan the newly discovered work, were still extant, one buried in the T‘UNG TIEN, Tu\\nYu’s great treatise on the Constitution, the other similarly enshrined in the T‘AI P‘ING\\nYU LAN encyclopedia. In both the complete text is to be found, though split up into\\nfragments, intermixed with other matter, and scattered piecemeal over a number of dif-\\nferent sections. Considering that the YU LAN takes us back to the year 983, and the\\nT‘UNG TIEN about 200 years further still, to the middle of the T‘ang dynasty, the\\nvalue of these early transcripts of Sun Tzu can hardly be overestimated. Yet the idea of\\nutilizing them does not seem to have occurred to anyone until Sun Hsing-yen, acting\\nunder Government instructions, undertook a thorough recension of the text. This is his\\nown account:\\nBecause of the numerous mistakes in the text of Sun Tzu which his editors\\nhad handed down, the Government ordered that the ancient edition [of\\nChi T‘ien-pao] should be used, and that the text should be revised and\\ncorrected throughout. It happened that Wu Nien-hu, the Governor Pi Kua,\\nand Hsi, a graduate of the second degree, had all devoted themselves to\\n35Preface ad fin: \\\"My family comes from Lo-an, and we are really descended from Sun Tzu.

Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition places him after Chia\\nLin,and Ch‘ao Kung- wu also assigns him to the T‘ang dynasty,40 but this is a\\nmistake. In Sun Hsing-yen’s preface, he appears as Meng Shih of the Liang dyn-\\nasty [502-557].

The T‘UNG CHIH\\nmentions \\\"Lives of famous generals from the Chou to the T‘ang dynasty\\\" as\\nwritten by him.41 According to Ch‘ao Kung-wu and the T‘IEN-I-KO catalogue,\\nhe followed a variant of the text of Sun Tzu which differs considerably from\\nthose now extant. His notes are mostly short and to the point, and he frequently\\nillustrates his remarks by anecdotes from Chinese history.\\n4. TU YU (died 812) did not publish a separate commentary on Sun Tzu, his notes\\nbeing taken from the T‘UNG TIEN, the encyclopedic treatise on the Constitution\\nwhich was his life- work. They are largely repetitions of Ts‘ao Kung and Meng\\nShih, besides which it is believed that he drew on the ancient commentaries of\\nWang Ling and others.

CH‘EN HAO appears to have been a contemporary of Tu Mu. Ch‘ao Kung-\\nwu says that he was impelled to write a new commentary on Sun Tzu because\\nTs‘ao Kung’s on the one hand was too obscure and subtle, and that of Tu Mu\\non the other too long-winded and diffuse. Ou-yang Hsiu, writing in the middle\\nof the 11th century, calls Ts‘ao Kung, Tu Mu and Ch‘en Hao the three chief\\ncommentators on Sun Tzu, and observes that Ch‘en Hao is continually attacking\\nTu Mu’s shortcomings.

His commentary was published with\\na laudatory preface by the great Ou-yang Hsiu, from which we may cull the fol-\\nlowing:\\nLater scholars have misread Sun Tzu, distorting his words and trying to make\\nthem square with their own one-sided views. Thus, though commentators have\\nnot been lacking, only a few have proved equal to the task. My friend Sheng-yu\\nhas not fallen into this mistake. In attempting to provide a critical commentary\\nfor Sun Tzu’s work, he does not lose sight of the fact that these sayings were in-\\ntended for states engaged in internecine warfare; that the author is not concerned\\nwith the military conditions prevailing under the sovereigns of the three ancient\\ndynasties,42 nor with the nine punitive measures prescribed to the Minister of\\nWar.43 Again, Sun Wu loved brevity of diction, but his meaning is always deep.\\nWhether the subject be marching an army, or handling soldiers, or estimating the\\nenemy, or controlling the forces of victory, it is always systematically treated; the\\nsayings are bound together in strict logical sequence, though this has been ob-\\nscured by commentators who have probably failed to grasp their meaning.

The personal name of this commentator is\\ngiven as above by Cheng Ch‘iao in the TUNG CHIH, written about the middle\\nof the twelfth century, but he appears simply as Ho Shih in the YU HAI, and Ma\\nTuan-lin quotes Ch‘ao Kung-wu as saying that his personal name is unknown.\\nThere seems to be no reason to doubt Cheng Ch‘iao’s statement, otherwise I\\nshould have been inclined to hazard a guess and identify him with one Ho Ch‘u-\\nfei, the author of a short treatise on war, who lived in the latter part of the 11th\\ncentury.

CHANG YU. The list closes with a commentator of no great originality perhaps,\\nbut gifted with admirable powers of lucid exposition. His commentator is based\\non that of Ts‘ao Kung, whose terse sentences he contrives to expand and develop\\nin masterly fashion. Without Chang Yu, it is safe to say that much of Ts‘ao\\nKung’s commentary would have remained cloaked in its pristine obscurity and\\ntherefore valueless. His work is not mentioned in the Sung history, the T‘UNG\\nK‘AO, or the YU HAI, but it finds a niche in the T‘UNG CHIH, which also\\nnames him as the author of the \\\"Lives of Famous Generals.\\\"45\\nIt is rather remarkable that the last-named four should all have flourished within\\nso short a space of time. Ch‘ao Kung-wu accounts for it by saying: \\\"During\\nthe early years of the Sung dynasty the Empire enjoyed a long spell of peace,\\nand men ceased to practice the art of war. but when [Chao] Yuan-hao’s rebellion\\ncame [1038-42] and the frontier generals were defeated time after time, the Court\\nmade strenuous inquiry for men skilled in war, and military topics became the\\n44T‘UNG K‘AO, ch. 221.\\n45This appears to be still extant.

Among the famous generals who are known to have studied his pages with en-\\nthusiasm may be mentioned Han Hsin (d. 196 B.C.),48 Feng I (d. 34 A.D.),49 Lu Meng\\n(d. 219),50 and Yo Fei (1103-1141).51 The opinion of Ts‘ao Kung, who disputes with\\nHan Hsin the highest place in Chinese military annals, has already been recorded.52\\nStill more remarkable, in one way, is the testimony of purely literary men, such as Su\\nHsun (the father of Su Tung-p‘o), who wrote several essays on military topics, all of\\nwhich owe their chief inspiration to Sun Tzu. The following short passage by him is\\npreserved in the YU HAI:53\\nSun Wu’s saying, that in war one cannot make certain of conquering,54 is\\nvery different indeed from what other books tell us.55 Wu Ch‘i was a man\\nof the same stamp as Sun Wu: they both wrote books on war, and they\\nare linked together in popular speech as \\\"Sun and Wu.\\\" But Wu Ch‘i’s\\nremarks on war are less weighty, his rules are rougher and more crudely\\nstated, and there is not the same unity of plan as in Sun Tzu’s work, where\\nthe style is terse, but the meaning fully brought out.\\nThe following is an extract from the \\\"Impartial Judgments in the Garden of Literature\\\"\\nby Cheng Hou:\\n46T‘UNG K‘AO, loc. cit.\\n47A notable person in his day.

Language of\\nthis sort, he says, \\\"encourages a ruler’s bent towards unrelenting warfare and reckless\\nmilitarism.\\\"\\n1.5 Apologies for War\\nAccustomed as we are to think of China as the greatest peace-loving nation on earth,\\nwe are in some danger of forgetting that her experience of war in all its phases has\\nalso been such as no modern State can parallel. Her long military annals stretch back\\nto a point at which they are lost in the mists of time. She had built the Great Wall\\nand was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries before the first\\nRoman legionary was seen on the Danube. What with the perpetual collisions of the\\nancient feudal States, the grim conflicts with Huns, Turks and other invaders after the\\ncentralization of government, the terrific upheavals which accompanied the overthrow\\nof so many dynasties, besides the countless rebellions and minor disturbances that have\\nflamed up and flickered out again one by one, it is hardly too much to say that the clash\\nof arms has never ceased to resound in one portion or another of the Empire.\\nNo less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom China can\\npoint with pride. As in all countries, the greatest are fond of emerging at the most\\nfateful crises of her history. Thus, Po Ch‘i stands out conspicuous in the period when\\nCh‘in was entering upon her final struggle with the remaining independent states. The\\nstormy years which followed the break-up of the Ch‘in dynasty are illuminated by\\nthe transcendent genius of Han Hsin. When the House of Han in turn is tottering to\\nits fall, the great and baleful figure of Ts‘ao Ts‘ao dominates the scene. And in the\\nestablishment of the T‘ang dynasty,one of the mightiest tasks achieved by man, the\\nsuperhuman energy of Li Shih-min (afterwards the Emperor T‘ai Tsung) was seconded\\nby the brilliant strategy of Li Ching. None of these generals need fear comparison with\\nthe greatest names in the military history of Europe.\\nIn spite of all this, the great body of Chinese sentiment, from Lao Tzu downwards,\\nand especially as reflected in the standard literature of Confucianism, has been consist-\\nently pacific and intensely opposed to militarism in any form. It is such an uncommon\\nthing to find any of the literati defending warfare on principle, that I have thought it\\nworth while to collect and translate a few passages in which the unorthodox view is\\nupheld. The following, by Ssu-ma Ch‘ien, shows that for all his ardent admiration of\\nConfucius, he was yet no advocate of peace at any price:\\n56The TSO CHUAN.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"XjnIwJkGKmX6etDrSXlzNjBkRua94O2USU6fOtWnScY=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_24":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_24\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":24,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

But the wielding of huge armies, the throw-\\ning down of fortified cities, the hauling of women and children into cap-\\ntivity, and the beheading of traitors – this is also work which is done by\\nofficials. The objects of the rack and of military weapons are essentially\\nthe same. There is no intrinsic difference between the punishment of flog-\\nging and cutting off heads in war. For the lesser infractions of law, which\\nare easily dealt with, only a small amount of force need be employed:\\nhence the use of military weapons and wholesale decapitation.

When Confucius held office under the Duke\\nof Lu, and a meeting was convened at Chia-ku,60 he said: \\\"If pacific ne-\\ngotiations are in progress, warlike preparations should have been made\\nbeforehand.\\\" He rebuked and shamed the Marquis of Ch‘i, who cowered\\nunder him and dared not proceed to violence. How can it be said that these\\ntwo great Sages had no knowledge of military matters?\\nWe have seen that the great Chu Hsi held Sun Tzu in high esteem. He also appeals to\\nthe authority of the Classics:\\nOur Master Confucius, answering Duke Ling of Wei, said: \\\"I have never\\nstudied matters connected with armies and battalions.\\\"61 Replying to K‘ung\\nWen-tzu, he said: I have not been instructed about buff-coats and weapons.\\\"\\nBut if we turn to the meeting at Chia-ku, we find that he used armed force\\nagainst the men of Lai, so that the marquis of Ch‘i was overawed. Again,\\nwhen the inhabitants of Pi revolted, the ordered his officers to attack them,\\nwhereupon they were defeated and fled in confusion. He once uttered the\\nwords: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\"62 And Jan Yu also said: \\\"The Sage exercises\\nboth civil and military functions.\\\"63 Can it be a fact that Confucius never\\nstudied or received instruction in the art of war? We can only say that he\\ndid not specially choose matters connected with armies and fighting to be\\nthe subject of his teaching.\\nSun Hsing-yen, the editor of Sun Tzu, writes in similar strain:\\nConfucius said: \\\"I am unversed in military matters.\\\"64 He also said: \\\"If\\nI fight, I conquer.\\\" Confucius ordered ceremonies and regulated music.\\nNow war constitutes one of the five classes of State ceremonial,65 and\\n59See SHU CHING, preface ss. 55.\\n60See SHIH CHI, ch. 47.\\n61Lun Yu, XV. 1.\\n62I failed to trace this utterance.\\n63Supra.\\n64Supra.\\n65The other four being worship, mourning, entertainment of guests, and festive rites.

INTRODUCTION 25\\nmust not be treated as an independent branch of study. Hence, the words\\n\\\"I am unversed in\\\" must be taken to mean that there are things which even\\nan inspired Teacher does not know. Those who have to lead an army and\\ndevise stratagems, must learn the art of war. But if one can command\\nthe services of a good general like Sun Tzu, who was employed by Wu\\nTzu-hsu, there is no need to learn it oneself. Hence the remark added by\\nConfucius: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\"\\nThe men of the present day, however, willfully interpret these words of\\nConfucius in their narrowest sense, as though he meant that books on the\\nart of war were not worth reading. With blind persistency, they adduce the\\nexample of Chao Kua, who pored over his father’s books to no purpose,66\\nas a proof that all military theory is useless. Again, seeing that books on\\nwar have to do with such things as opportunism in designing plans, and\\nthe conversion of spies, they hold that the art is immoral and unworthy of\\na sage. These people ignore the fact that the studies of our scholars and\\nthe civil administration of our officials also require steady application and\\npractice before efficiency is reached. The ancients were particularly chary\\nof allowing mere novices to botch their work.67 Weapons are baneful68\\nand fighting perilous; and useless unless a general is in constant practice,\\nhe ought not to hazard other men’s lives in battle.69 Hence it is essential\\nthat Sun Tzu’s 13 chapters should be studied.\\nHsiang Liang used to instruct his nephew Chi70 in the art of war. Chi got\\na rough idea of the art in its general bearings, but would not pursue his\\nstudies to their proper outcome, the consequence being that he was finally\\ndefeated and overthrown. He did not realize that the tricks and artifices\\nof war are beyond verbal computation. Duke Hsiang of Sung and King\\nYen of Hsu were brought to destruction by their misplaced humanity. The\\ntreacherous and underhand nature of war necessitates the use of guile and\\nstratagem suited to the occasion. There is a case on record of Confucius\\nhimself having violated an extorted oath,71 and also of his having left the\\nSung State in disguise.72 Can we then recklessly arraign Sun Tzu for dis-\\nregarding truth and honesty?\\n66See XIII. ss. 11, note.\\n67This is a rather obscure allusion to the TSO CHUAN, where Tzu-ch‘an says: \\\"If you have a piece of\\nbeautiful brocade, you will not employ a mere learner to make it up.\\\"\\n68Cf.

Ts‘ao Kung, Li Ch‘uan, Meng Shih, Tu Yu, Tu Mu and\\nMei Yao-ch‘en have notes to the effect that a general, though naturally\\nstupid, may nevertheless conquer through sheer force of rapidity. Ho\\nShih says: \\\"Haste may be stupid, but at any rate it saves expenditure of\\nenergy and treasure; protracted operations may be very clever, but they\\nbring calamity in their train.\\\" Wang Hsi evades the difficulty by remark-\\ning: \\\"Lengthy operations mean an army growing old, wealth being expen-\\nded, an empty exchequer and distress among the people; true cleverness\\ninsures against the occurrence of such calamities.\\\" Chang Yu says: \\\"So\\nlong as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable to clever dilat-\\noriness.\\\" Now Sun Tzu says nothing whatever, except possibly by implic-\\nation, about ill-considered haste being better than ingenious but lengthy\\noperations. What he does say is something much more guarded, namely\\nthat, while speed may sometimes be injudicious, tardiness can never be\\nanything but foolish – if only because it means impoverishment to the na-\\ntion. In considering the point raised here by Sun Tzu, the classic example\\nof Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur to the mind. That general de-\\nliberately measured the endurance of Rome against that of Hannibals’s\\nisolated army, because it seemed to him that the latter was more likely to\\nsuffer from a long campaign in a strange country. But it is quite a moot\\nquestion whether his tactics would have proved successful in the long run.\\nTheir reversal it is true, led to Cannae; but this only establishes a negative\\npresumption in their favor.]\\n6. There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.\\n7. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can\\nthoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.\\n[That is, with rapidity. Only one who knows the disastrous effects of a\\nlong war can realize the supreme importance of rapidity in bringing it to\\na close.

B.C.] says: ’Direct warfare\\nfavors frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.’ Ts‘ao Kung\\nsays: ’Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation; appearing on\\nthe enemy’s rear is an indirect maneuver.’ Li Wei-kung [6th and 7th cent.\\nA.D.] says: ’In war, to march straight ahead is CHENG; turning move-\\nments, on the other hand, are CH‘I.’ These writers simply regard CHENG\\nas CHENG, and CH‘I as CH‘I; they do not note that the two are mutually\\ninterchangeable and run into each other like the two sides of a circle [see\\ninfra, ss. 11]. A comment on the T‘ang Emperor T‘ai Tsung goes to the\\nroot of the matter: ’A CH‘I maneuver may be CHENG, if we make the\\nenemy look upon it as CHENG; then our real attack will be CH‘I, and vice\\nversa. The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot\\nfathom our real intent.’\\\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack\\nor other operation is CHENG, on which the enemy has had his attention\\nfixed; whereas that is CH‘I,\\\" which takes him by surprise or comes from\\nan unexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant\\nto be CH‘I,\\\" it immediately becomes CHENG.\\\"]\\n4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an\\negg - this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.\\n5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect\\nmethods will be needed in order to secure victory.\\n[Chang Yu says: \\\"Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding\\nthe enemy’s flanks or falling on his rear.\\\" A brilliant example of \\\"indirect\\ntactics\\\" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord Roberts’ night\\nmarch round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.1\\n6.

There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general:\\n(1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction;\\n[\\\"Bravery without forethought,\\\" as Ts‘ao Kung analyzes it, which causes\\na man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad bull.

IV. ad init.: \\\"In\\nestimating the character of a general, men are wont to pay exclusive at-\\ntention to his courage, forgetting that courage is only one out of many\\nqualities which a general should possess.

And the inhabitants of Chi-mo, witnessing the out-\\nrage from the city-walls, wept passionately and were all impatient to go out\\nand fight, their fury being increased tenfold.

But instead of a sword, he himself\\ntoo a mattock in his hands, and ordered others to be distributed amongst\\nhis best warriors, while the ranks were filled up with their wives and con-\\ncubines.

The Wei general Ssu-ma I was then military governor of Wan, and\\ngetting wind of Meng Ta’s treachery, he at once set off with an army to\\nanticipate his revolt, having previously cajoled him by a specious message\\nof friendly import. Ssu-ma’s officers came to him and said: \\\"If Meng Ta\\nhas leagued himself with Wu and Shu, the matter should be thoroughly\\ninvestigated before we make a move.\\\" Ssu-ma I replied: \\\"Meng Ta is an\\nunprincipled man, and we ought to go and punish him at once, while he is\\nstill wavering and before he has thrown off the mask.\\\" Then, by a series of\\nforced marches, be brought his army under the walls of Hsin-ch‘eng with\\nin a space of eight days. Now Meng Ta had previously said in a letter to\\nChu-ko Liang: \\\"Wan is 1200 LI from here. When the news of my revolt\\nreaches Ssu-ma I, he will at once inform his imperial master, but it will be\\na whole month before any steps can be taken, and by that time my city will\\nbe well fortified. Besides, Ssu-ma I is sure not to come himself, and the\\ngenerals that will be sent against us are not worth troubling about.\\\" The\\nnext letter, however, was filled with consternation: \\\"Though only eight\\ndays have passed since I threw off my allegiance, an army is already at\\nthe city-gates. What miraculous rapidity is this!\\\" A fortnight later, Hsin-\\nch‘eng had fallen and Meng Ta had lost his head. [See CHIN SHU, ch.\\n1, f. 3.] In 621 A.D., Li Ching was sent from K‘uei-chou in Ssu-ch‘uan\\nto reduce the successful rebel Hsiao Hsien, who had set up as Emperor at\\nthe modern Ching-chou Fu in Hupeh. It was autumn, and the Yangtsze\\nbeing then in flood, Hsiao Hsien never dreamt that his adversary would\\nventure to come down through the gorges, and consequently made no pre-\\nparations.

He had invaded the Ch‘u State, where a universal levy\\nwas made to oppose him. But, being doubtful of the temper of his troops,\\nhe declined all invitations to fight and remained strictly on the defens-\\nive. In vain did the Ch‘u general try to force a battle: day after day Wang\\nChien kept inside his walls and would not come out, but devoted his whole\\ntime and energy to winning the affection and confidence of his men. He\\ntook care that they should be well fed, sharing his own meals with them,\\nprovided facilities for bathing, and employed every method of judicious\\nindulgence to weld them into a loyal and homogenous body. After some\\ntime had elapsed, he told off certain persons to find out how the men were\\namusing themselves. The answer was, that they were contending with one\\nanother in putting the weight and long-jumping. When Wang Chien heard\\nthat they were engaged in these athletic pursuits, he knew that their spir-\\nits had been strung up to the required pitch and that they were now ready\\nfor fighting. By this time the Ch‘u army, after repeating their challenge\\nagain and again, had marched away eastwards in disgust.

For it is the soldier’s disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when sur-\\nrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly\\nwhen he has fallen into danger.\\n[Chang Yu alludes to the conduct of Pan Ch‘ao’s devoted followers in 73\\nA.D. The story runs thus in the HOU HAN SHU, ch. 47: \\\"When Pan\\nCh‘ao arrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the country, received him\\nat first with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards his be-\\nhavior underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss and negligent.\\nPan Ch‘ao spoke about this to the officers of his suite: ’Have you no-\\nticed,’ he said, ’that Kuang’s polite intentions are on the wane? This must\\nsignify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians, and that con-\\nsequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with which side to\\nthrow in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly wise man, we are\\ntold, can perceive things before they have come to pass; how much more,\\nthen, those that are already manifest!’ Thereupon he called one of the nat-\\nives who had been assigned to his service, and set a trap for him, saying:\\n’Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu who arrived some day ago?’\\nThe man was so taken aback that between surprise and fear he presently\\nblurted out the whole truth. Pan Ch‘ao, keeping his informant carefully\\nunder lock and key, then summoned a general gathering of his officers,\\nthirty-six in all, and began drinking with them. When the wine had moun-\\nted into their heads a little, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by\\naddressing them thus: ’Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated\\nregion, anxious to achieve riches and honor by some great exploit. Now it\\nhappens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom\\nonly a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy extended\\ntowards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this envoy prevail\\nupon him to seize our party and hand us over to the Hsiung-no, our bones\\nwill become food for the wolves of the desert. What are we to do?’ With\\none accord, the officers replied: ’Standing as we do in peril of our lives,\\nwe will follow our commander through life and death.’ For the sequel of\\nthis adventure, see chap. XII. ss. 1, note.]\\n52. We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are ac-\\nquainted with their designs.

With regard to local guides, Sun Tzu might have added that\\nthere is always the risk of going wrong, either through their treachery or\\nsome misunderstanding such as Livy records (XXII. 13): Hannibal, we are\\ntold, ordered a guide to lead him into the neighborhood of Casinum, where\\nthere was an important pass to be occupied; but his Carthaginian accent,\\nunsuited to the pronunciation of Latin names, caused the guide to under-\\nstand Casilinum instead of Casinum, and turning from his proper route, he\\ntook the army in that direction, the mistake not being discovered until they\\nhad almost arrived.]\\n53. To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not\\nbefit a warlike prince.\\n54. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows it-\\nself in preventing the concentration of the enemy’s forces. He overawes\\nhis opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.\\n[Mei Tao-ch‘en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so much\\naffected by the Chinese: \\\"In attacking a powerful state, if you can divide\\nher forces, you will have a superiority in strength; if you have a superi-\\nority in strength, you will overawe the enemy; if you overawe the enemy,\\nthe neighboring states will be frightened; and if the neighboring states are\\nfrightened, the enemy’s allies will be prevented from joining her.\\\" The fol-\\nlowing gives a stronger meaning: \\\"If the great state has once been defeated\\n(before she has had time to summon her allies), then the lesser states will\\nhold aloof and refrain from massing their forces.\\\" Ch‘en Hao and Chang\\nYu take the sentence in quite another way. The former says: \\\"Powerful\\nthough a prince may be, if he attacks a large state, he will be unable to\\nraise enough troops, and must rely to some extent on external aid; if he\\ndispenses with this, and with overweening confidence in his own strength,\\nsimply tries to intimidate the enemy, he will surely be defeated.\\\" Chang Yu\\nputs his view thus: \\\"If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people\\nwill be discontented and hang back. But if (as will then be the case) our\\ndisplay of military force is inferior by half to that of the enemy, the other\\nchieftains will take fright and refuse to join us.\\\"]\\n55. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he\\nfoster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs,\\nkeeping his antagonists in awe.\\n[The train of thought, as said by Li Ch‘uan, appears to be this: Secure\\nagainst a combination of his enemies, \\\"he can afford to reject entangling\\nalliances and simply pursue his own secret designs, his prestige enable him\\nto dispense with external friendships.\\\"]\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"dZbS4Ia1weqGtLeUKiWuMHy9Si7H60ORSU1yFQ0qsuo=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_111":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_111\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":111,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 12.

THE NINE SITUATIONS 111\\n[These words of Sun Tzu were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation\\nof the tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already al-\\nluded to on p. 28. In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao,\\nand halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the\\nenemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body\\nof 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red flag.\\nTheir instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles and keep\\na secret watch on the enemy. \\\"When the men of Chao see me in full flight,\\\"\\nHan Hsin said, \\\"they will abandon their fortifications and give chase. This\\nmust be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down the Chao standards and\\nset up the red banners of Han in their stead.\\\" Turning then to his other\\nofficers, he remarked: \\\"Our adversary holds a strong position, and is not\\nlikely to come out and attack us until he sees the standard and drums of\\nthe commander-in-chief, for fear I should turn back and escape through\\nthe mountains.\\\" So saying, he first of all sent out a division consisting of\\n10,000 men, and ordered them to form in line of battle with their backs to\\nthe River Ti. Seeing this maneuver, the whole army of Chao broke into\\nloud laughter. By this time it was broad daylight, and Han Hsin, display-\\ning the generalissimo’s flag, marched out of the pass with drums beating,\\nand was immediately engaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, last-\\ning for some time; until at length Han Hsin and his colleague Chang Ni,\\nleaving drums and banner on the field, fled to the division on the river\\nbank, where another fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to\\npursue them and to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of\\nmen; but the two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was\\nfighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the 2000\\nhorsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men of Chao fol-\\nlowing up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls, tore\\nup the enemy’s flags and replaced them by those of Han. When the Chao\\narmy looked back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags struck them\\nwith terror. Convinced that the Hans had got in and overpowered their\\nking, they broke up in wild disorder, every effort of their leader to stay\\nthe panic being in vain. Then the Han army fell on them from both sides\\nand completed the rout, killing a number and capturing the rest, amongst\\nwhom was King Ya himself.... After the battle, some of Han Hsin’s of-\\nficers came to him and said: \\\"In the ART OF WAR we are told to have\\na hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a river or marsh on the left front.\\n[This appears to be a blend of Sun Tzu and T‘ai Kung.

Meanwhile, Li Hsiung’s general, Li Hsiang,\\nhad prepared an ambuscade on their line of march; and P‘o-t‘ai, having\\nreared long scaling-ladders against the city walls, now lighted the beacon-\\nfire. Wei Po’s men raced up on seeing the signal and began climbing the\\nladders as fast as they could, while others were drawn up by ropes lowered\\nfrom above. More than a hundred of Lo Shang’s soldiers entered the city\\nin this way, every one of whom was forthwith beheaded. Li Hsiung then\\ncharged with all his forces, both inside and outside the city, and routed the\\nenemy completely.\\\" [This happened in 303 A.D. I do not know where Ho\\nShih got the story from.

He also refers to T‘ang\\nChien, who in 630 A.D. was sent by T‘ai Tsung to lull the Turkish Kahn\\nChieh-li into fancied security, until Li Ching was able to deliver a crushing\\nblow against him.

Its introduction to Europe began in 1782 when a French\\nJesuit Father living in China, Joseph Amiot, acquired a copy of it, and translated it into\\nFrench. It was not a good translation because, according to Dr. Giles, \\\"[I]t contains a\\ngreat deal that Sun Tzu did not write, and very little indeed of what he did.\\\"\\nThe first translation into English was published in 1905 in Tokyo by Capt. E. F.\\nCalthrop, R.F.A. However, this translation is, in the words of Dr. Giles, \\\"excessively\\nbad.\\\" He goes further in this criticism: \\\"It is not merely a question of downright blun-\\nders, from which none can hope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent; hard\\npassages were willfully distorted or slurred over. Such offenses are less pardonable.\\nThey would not be tolerated in any edition of a Latin or Greek classic, and a similar\\nstandard of honesty ought to be insisted upon in translations from Chinese.\\\" In 1908\\na new edition of Capt. Calthrop’s translation was published in London. It was an im-\\nprovement on the first – omissions filled up and numerous mistakes corrected – but\\nnew errors were created in the process. Dr. Giles, in justifying his translation, wrote:\\n\\\"It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate of my own powers; but I could not\\nhelp feeling that Sun Tzu deserved a better fate than had befallen him, and I knew that,\\nat any rate, I could hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors.\\\"\\nClearly, Dr. Giles’ work established much of the groundwork for the work of later\\ntranslators who published their own editions. Of the later editions of the ART OF WAR\\nI have examined; two feature Giles’ edited translation and notes, the other two present\\nthe same basic information from the ancient Chinese commentators found in the Giles\\nedition. Of these four, Giles’ 1910 edition is the most scholarly and presents the reader\\nan incredible amount of information concerning Sun Tzu’s text, much more than any\\nother translation.\\nThe Giles’ edition of the ART OF WAR, as stated above, was a scholarly work.\\nDr. Giles was a leading sinologue at the time and an assistant in the Department of\\nOriental Printed Books and Manuscripts in the British Museum. Apparently he wanted\\nto produce a definitive edition, superior to anything else that existed and perhaps some-\\nthing that would become a standard translation. It was the best translation available for\\n50 years. But apparently there was not much interest in Sun Tzu in English- speaking\\ncountries since it took the start of the Second World War to renew interest in his work.\\nSeveral people published unsatisfactory English translations of Sun Tzu. In 1944, Dr.\\nGiles’ translation was edited and published in the United States in a series of military\\nscience books. But it wasn’t until 1963 that a good English translation (by Samuel B.\\nGriffith and still in print) was published that was an equal to Giles’ translation. While\\nthis translation is more lucid than Dr. Giles’ translation, it lacks his copious notes that\\nmake his so interesting.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3368,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"HxjtMeWkeRaVUV6+fL+J9i5Qo4aoaICJWVkz+65AwmA=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"8aa8bfa7-a062-4868-9005-0b743ac237da":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"8aa8bfa7-a062-4868-9005-0b743ac237da\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"CuCyFAgqy0MiC12tTvSHyRl+cG3yun7bf3NrXWFuOZs=\"}},\"text\":\"CONTENTS 4\\nDr. Giles produced a work primarily intended for scholars of the Chinese civiliza-\\ntion and language.

But if his orders ARE clear, and the\\nsoldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers.\\\"\\nSo saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be beheaded.\\nNow the king of Wu was watching the scene from the top of a raised\\npavilion; and when he saw that his favorite concubines were about to be\\nexecuted, he was greatly alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following\\nmessage: \\\"We are now quite satisfied as to our general’s ability to handle\\ntroops. If We are bereft of these two concubines, our meat and drink will\\nlose their savor. It is our wish that they shall not be beheaded.\\\"\\nSun Tzu replied: \\\"Having once received His Majesty’s commission to\\nbe the general of his forces, there are certain commands of His Majesty\\nwhich, acting in that capacity, I am unable to accept.\\\"\\nAccordingly, he had the two leaders beheaded, and straightway installed\\nthe pair next in order as leaders in their place. When this had been done,\\nthe drum was sounded for the drill once more; and the girls went through\\nall the evolutions, turning to the right or to the left, marching ahead or\\nwheeling back, kneeling or standing, with perfect accuracy and precision,\\nnot venturing to utter a sound. Then Sun Tzu sent a messenger to the King\\nsaying: \\\"Your soldiers, Sire, are now properly drilled and disciplined, and\\nready for your majesty’s inspection. They can be put to any use that their\\nsovereign may desire; bid them go through fire and water, and they will\\nnot disobey.\\\"\\nBut the King replied: \\\"Let our general cease drilling and return to camp.\\nAs for us, We have no wish to come down and inspect the troops.\\\"\\nThereupon Sun Tzu said: \\\"The King is only fond of words, and cannot\\ntranslate them into deeds.\\\"\\nAfter that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tzu was one who knew how to handle an\\narmy, and finally appointed him general. In the west, he defeated the Ch‘u\\nState and forced his way into Ying, the capital; to the north he put fear\\ninto the States of Ch‘i and Chin, and spread his fame abroad amongst the\\nfeudal princes. And Sun Tzu shared in the might of the King.\\nAbout Sun Tzu himself this is all that Ssu-ma Ch‘ien has to tell us in this chapter. But\\nhe proceeds to give a biography of his descendant, Sun Pin, born about a hundred years\\nafter his famous ancestor’s death, and also the outstanding military genius of his time.\\nThe historian speaks of him too as Sun Tzu, and in his preface we read: \\\"Sun Tzu\\nhad his feet cut off and yet continued to discuss the art of war.\\\"3 It seems likely, then,\\nthat \\\"Pin\\\" was a nickname bestowed on him after his mutilation, unless the story was\\ninvented in order to account for the name.

He is mentioned in two other passages of the SHIH\\nCHI:\\nIn the third year of his reign [512 B.C.] Ho Lu, king of Wu, took the\\nfield with Tzu-hsu [i.e. Wu Yuan] and Po P‘ei, and attacked Ch‘u. He\\ncaptured the town of Shu and slew the two prince’s sons who had formerly\\nbeen generals of Wu. He was then meditating a descent on Ying [the\\ncapital]; but the general Sun Wu said: \\\"The army is exhausted. It is not\\nyet possible. We must wait\\\".... [After further successful fighting,] \\\"in the\\nninth year [506 B.C.], King Ho Lu addressed Wu Tzu-hsu and Sun Wu,\\nsaying: \\\"Formerly, you declared that it was not yet possible for us to enter\\nYing. Is the time ripe now?\\\" The two men replied: \\\"Ch‘u’s general Tzu-\\nch‘ang, 4 is grasping and covetous, and the princes of T‘ang and Ts‘ai both\\nhave a grudge against him. If Your Majesty has resolved to make a grand\\nattack, you must win over T‘ang and Ts‘ai, and then you may succeed.\\\"\\nHo Lu followed this advice, [beat Ch‘u in five pitched battles and marched\\ninto Ying.]5\\nThis is the latest date at which anything is recorded of Sun Wu. He does not appear to\\nhave survived his patron, who died from the effects of a wound in 496.\\nIn another chapter there occurs this passage:6\\nFrom this time onward, a number of famous soldiers arose, one after the\\nother: Kao-fan,7 who was employed by the Chin State; Wang-tzu,8 in the\\nservice of Ch‘i; and Sun Wu, in the service of Wu. These men developed\\nand threw light upon the principles of war.\\nIt is obvious enough that Ssu-ma Ch‘ien at least had no doubt about the reality of Sun\\nWu as an historical personage; and with one exception, to be noticed presently, he is\\nby far the most important authority on the period in question. It will not be necessary,\\ntherefore, to say much of such a work as the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU, which is\\nsupposed to have been written by Chao Yeh of the 1st century A.D. The attribution is\\nsomewhat doubtful; but even if it were otherwise, his account would be of little value,\\nbased as it is on the SHIH CHI and expanded with romantic details. The story of Sun\\nTzu will be found, for what it is worth, in chapter 2. The only new points in it worth\\nnoting are: (1) Sun Tzu was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu Tzu-hsu. (2) He is\\ncalled a native of Wu. (3) He had previously lived a retired life, and his contemporaries\\nwere unaware of his ability.\\nThe following passage occurs in the Huai-nan Tzu: \\\"When sovereign and ministers\\nshow perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tzu to encounter the foe.\\\"\\n4The appellation of Nang Wa.\\n5SHI CHI, ch. 31.\\n6SHI CHI, ch. 25.\\n7The appellation of Hu Yen, mentioned in ch. 39 under the year 637.\\n8Wang-tzu Ch‘eng-fu, ch. 32, year 607.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2853,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"GuiP9LvYG8Kfs58c4l/gjpvR5GfFRULUDLruvB2b2M8=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"dd5b8cee-3c3e-4634-b81e-7562bee2f1b4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"dd5b8cee-3c3e-4634-b81e-7562bee2f1b4\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"21LSzLE69K/XiaKoIr5SFxyGY8i9M7AkN6wV/ANLl7c=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

Sun Wu’s father Sun P‘ing, rose\\nto be a Minister of State in Ch‘i, and Sun Wu himself, whose style was Ch‘ang-ch‘ing,\\nfled to Wu on account of the rebellion which was being fomented by the kindred of\\nT‘ien Pao. He had three sons, of whom the second, named Ming, was the father of Sun\\nPin. According to this account then, Pin was the grandson of Wu, which, considering\\nthat Sun Pin’s victory over Wei was gained in 341 B.C., may be dismissed as chronolo-\\ngical impossible. Whence these data were obtained by Teng Ming-shih I do not know,\\nbut of course no reliance whatever can be placed in them.\\nAn interesting document which has survived from the close of the Han period is\\nthe short preface written by the Great Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, or Wei Wu Ti, for his edition of Sun\\nTzu.

The SSU-MA FA says: \\\"If one\\nman slay another of set purpose, he himself may rightfully be slain.\\\" He\\nwho relies solely on warlike measures shall be exterminated; he who relies\\nsolely on peaceful measures shall perish.

He was a descendant of Wu.] 12 In his treatment of\\ndeliberation and planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the field, 13\\nclearness of conception, and depth of design, Sun Tzu stands beyond the\\nreach of carping criticism. My contemporaries, however, have failed to\\ngrasp the full meaning of his instructions, and while putting into practice\\nthe smaller details in which his work abounds, they have overlooked its\\nessential purport. That is the motive which has led me to outline a rough\\nexplanation of the whole.\\nOne thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit statement that the 13 chapters were\\nspecially composed for King Ho Lu. This is supported by the internal evidence of I. ss.\\n15, in which it seems clear that some ruler is addressed.\\nIn the bibliographic section of the HAN SHU, there is an entry which has given\\nrise to much discussion: \\\"The works of Sun Tzu of Wu in 82 P‘IEN (or chapters), with\\ndiagrams in 9 CHUAN.\\\" It is evident that this cannot be merely the 13 chapters known\\nto Ssu-ma Ch‘ien, or those we possess today. Chang Shou-chieh refers to an edition\\nof Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR of which the \\\"13 chapters\\\" formed the first CHUAN,\\nadding that there were two other CHUAN besides. This has brought forth a theory, that\\nthe bulk of these 82 chapters consisted of other writings of Sun Tzu – we should call\\nthem apocryphal – similar to the WEN TA, of which a specimen dealing with the Nine\\nSituations14 is preserved in the T‘UNG TIEN, and another in Ho Shin’s commentary.\\nIt is suggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzu had only written the\\n13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of question and\\nanswer between himself and the King. Pi I-hsun, the author of the SUN TZU HSU\\nLU, backs this up with a quotation from the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU: \\\"The King of\\nWu summoned Sun Tzu, and asked him questions about the art of war. Each time he\\nset forth a chapter of his work, the King could not find words enough to praise him.\\\"\\nAs he points out, if the whole work was expounded on the same scale as in the above-\\nmentioned fragments, the total number of chapters could not fail to be considerable.\\nThen the numerous other treatises attributed to Sun Tzu might be included. The fact\\nthat the HAN CHIH mentions no work of Sun Tzu except the 82 P‘IEN, whereas the\\nSui and T‘ang bibliographies give the titles of others in addition to the \\\"13 chapters,\\\" is\\ngood proof, Pi I-hsun thinks, that all of these were contained in the 82 P‘IEN. Without\\npinning our faith to the accuracy of details supplied by the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU,\\nor admitting the genuineness of any of the treatises cited by Pi I-hsun, we may see in\\nthis theory a probable solution of the mystery. Between Ssu-ma Ch‘ien and Pan Ku\\nthere was plenty of time for a luxuriant crop of forgeries to have grown up under the\\nmagic name of Sun Tzu, and the 82 P‘IEN may very well represent a collected edition\\nof these lumped together with the original work. It is also possible, though less likely,\\nthat some of them existed in the time of the earlier historian and were purposely ignored\\nby him.15\\n12The passage I have put in brackets is omitted in the T‘U SHU, and may be an interpolation. It was\\nknown, however to Chang Shou-chieh of the T‘ang dynasty, and appears in the T‘AI P‘ING YU LAN.\\n13Ts‘ao Kung seems to be thinking of the first part of chap. II, perhaps especially of ss. 8.\\n14See chap. XI.\\n15On the other hand, it is noteworthy that WU TZU, which is not in 6 chapters, has 48 assigned to it in the\\nHAN CHIH.

This, as Sun Hsing-yen points\\nout, is only a modest way of saying that he made an explanatory paraphrase, or in other\\nwords, wrote a commentary on it. On the whole, this theory has met with very little\\nacceptance. Thus, the SSU K‘U CH‘UAN SHU says: \\\"The mention of the 13 chapters\\nin the SHIH CHI shows that they were in existence before the HAN CHIH, and that\\nlatter accretions are not to be considered part of the original work. Tu Mu’s assertion\\ncan certainly not be taken as proof.\\\"\\nThere is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters existed in the time of\\nSsu-ma Ch‘ien practically as we have them now. That the work was then well known\\nhe tells us in so many words. \\\"Sun Tzu’s 13 Chapters and Wu Ch‘i’s Art of War are the\\ntwo books that people commonly refer to on the subject of military matters. Both of\\nthem are widely distributed, so I will not discuss them here.\\\" But as we go further back,\\nserious difficulties begin to arise. The salient fact which has to be faced is that the TSO\\nCHUAN, the greatest contemporary record, makes no mention whatsoever of Sun Wu,\\neither as a general or as a writer. It is natural, in view of this awkward circumstance,\\nthat many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story of Sun Wu as given in the\\nSHIH CHI, but even show themselves frankly skeptical as to the existence of the man\\nat all. The most powerful presentment of this side of the case is to be found in the\\nfollowing disposition by Yeh Shui-hsin:16\\nIt is stated in Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s history that Sun Wu was a native of the Ch‘i\\nState, and employed by Wu; and that in the reign of Ho Lu he crushed\\nCh‘u, entered Ying, and was a great general. But in Tso’s Commentary no\\nSun Wu appears at all. It is true that Tso’s Commentary need not contain\\nabsolutely everything that other histories contain. But Tso has not omitted\\nto mention vulgar plebeians and hireling ruffians such as Ying K‘ao-shu,17\\nTs‘ao Kuei,18, Chu Chih-wu and Chuan She-chu19. In the case of Sun\\nWu, whose fame and achievements were so brilliant, the omission is much\\nmore glaring. Again, details are given, in their due order, about his con-\\ntemporaries Wu Yuan and the Minister P‘ei.20 Is it credible that Sun Wu\\nalone should have been passed over?\\nIn point of literary style, Sun Tzu’s work belongs to the same school as\\nKUAN TZU,21 LIU T‘AO,22 and the YUEH YU23 and may have been the\\nproduction of some private scholar living towards the end of the \\\"Spring\\nthe case of very short works, one is tempted to think that P‘IEN might simply mean \\\"leaves.\\\"\\n16Yeh Shih of the Sung dynasty [1151-1223].\\n17He hardly deserves to be bracketed with assassins.\\n18See Chapter 7, ss. 27 and Chapter 11, ss. 28.\\n19See Chapter 11, ss. 28.

Moreover, as\\nwe know that Wu Yuan and Po P‘ei both took part in the expedition, and also that its\\nsuccess was largely due to the dash and enterprise of Fu Kai, Ho Lu’s younger brother,\\nit is not easy to see how yet another general could have played a very prominent part\\nin the same campaign.\\nCh‘en Chen-sun of the Sung dynasty has the note:\\nMilitary writers look upon Sun Wu as the father of their art.

fact that quotations from the ART\\nOF WAR, acknowledged or otherwise, are to be found in so many authors of differ-\\nent epochs, establishes a very strong anterior to them all, – in other words, that Sun\\nTzu’s treatise was already in existence towards the end of the 5th century B.C.Further\\nproof of Sun Tzu’s antiquity is furnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings\\nattaching to a number of the words he uses.A list of these, which might perhaps be\\nextended, is given in the HSU LU; and though some of the interpretations are doubtful,\\nthe main argument is hardly affected thereby.Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh\\nShui- hsin, a scholar and critic of the first rank, deliberately pronounces the style of the\\n13 chapters to belong to the early part of the fifth century.Seeing that he is actually\\nengaged in an attempt to disprove the existence of Sun Wu himself, we may be sure that\\nhe would not have hesitated to assign the work to a later date had he not honestly be-\\nlieved the contrary.And it is precisely on such a point that the judgment of an educated\\nChinaman will carry most weight.Other internal evidence is not far to seek.Thus in\\nXIII.ss.1, there is an unmistakable allusion to the ancient system of land-tenure which\\nhad already passed away by the time of Mencius, who was anxious to see it revived in\\na modified form.29 The only warfare Sun Tzu knows is that carried on between the\\nvarious feudal princes, in which armored chariots play a large part.Their use seems to\\nhave entirely died out before the end of the Chou dynasty.He speaks as a man of Wu,\\na state which ceased to exist as early as 473 B.C.On this I shall touch presently.But once refer the work to the 5th century or earlier, and the chances of its being\\nother than a bona fide production are sensibly diminished.The great age of forgeries\\ndid not come until long after.That it should have been forged in the period immedi-\\nately following 473 is particularly unlikely, for no one, as a rule, hastens to identify\\nhimself with a lost cause.As for Yeh Shui-hsin’s theory, that the author was a literary\\nrecluse, that seems to me quite untenable.If one thing is more apparent than another\\nafter reading the maxims of Sun Tzu, it is that their essence has been distilled from\\na large store of personal observation and experience.They reflect the mind not only\\nof a born strategist, gifted with a rare faculty of generalization, but also of a practical\\nsoldier closely acquainted with the military conditions of his time.To say nothing of\\nthe fact that these sayings have been accepted and endorsed by all the greatest captains\\nof Chinese history, they offer a combination of freshness and sincerity, acuteness and\\ncommon sense, which quite excludes the idea that they were artificially concocted in\\nthe study.If we admit, then, that the 13 chapters were the genuine production of a\\nmilitary man living towards the end of the \\\"CH‘UN CH‘IU\\\" period, are we not bound,\\nin spite of the silence of the TSO CHUAN, to accept Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s account in its\\nentirety?In view of his high repute as a sober historian,

There is still one grave, if not fatal, objec-\\ntion to the chronology involved in the story as told in the SHIH CHI, which, so far as I\\nam aware, nobody has yet pointed out. There are two passages in Sun Tzu in which he\\nalludes to contemporary affairs. The first in in VI. ss. 21:\\nThough according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in\\nnumber, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say\\nthen that victory can be achieved.\\nThe other is in XI. ss. 30:\\nAsked if an army can be made to imitate the SHUAI-JAN, I should answer,\\nYes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are\\ncrossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come\\nto each other’s assistance just as the left hand helps the right.\\nThese two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of composition.\\nThey assign the work to the period of the struggle between Wu and Yueh. So much\\nhas been observed by Pi I-hsun. But what has hitherto escaped notice is that they also\\nseriously impair the credibility of Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s narrative. As we have seen above,\\nthe first positive date given in connection with Sun Wu is 512 B.C. He is then spoken\\nof as a general, acting as confidential adviser to Ho Lu, so that his alleged introduction\\nto that monarch had already taken place, and of course the 13 chapters must have been\\nwritten earlier still. But at that time, and for several years after, down to the capture\\nof Ying in 506, Ch‘u and not Yueh, was the great hereditary enemy of Wu. The two\\nstates, Ch‘u and Wu, had been constantly at war for over half a century, 30 whereas the\\nfirst war between Wu and Yueh was waged only in 510, 31 and even then was no more\\nthan a short interlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with Ch‘u. Now\\nCh‘u is not mentioned in the 13 chapters at all. The natural inference is that they were\\nwritten at a time when Yueh had become the prime antagonist of Wu, that is, after Ch‘u\\nhad suffered the great humiliation of 506. At this point, a table of dates may be found\\nuseful.\\n30When Wu first appears in the CH‘UN CH‘IU in 584, it is already at variance with its powerful neighbor.\\nThe CH‘UN CH‘IU first mentions Yueh in 537, the TSO CHUAN in 601.\\n31This is explicitly stated in the TSO CHUAN, XXXII, 2.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2454,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"/AHi4uVmBsmZKCf88BNNduJKIh5L57Y1QvWCaVf5gBs=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"bbc5eea9-c3aa-4bcc-869c-e26eba713ed2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"bbc5eea9-c3aa-4bcc-869c-e26eba713ed2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_15\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"dMiiNgBvAV+6QNBy48DAQFzVlxoQoBfyFHECNneFzv8=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

It seems rather to imply that, for the moment at\\nleast, the tide had turned against Wu, and that she was getting the worst of the struggle.\\nHence we may conclude that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which\\ndate Yueh does not appear to have scored any notable success against Wu. Ho Lu died\\nin 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must have been during the period\\n505-496, when there was a lull in the hostilities, Wu having presumably exhausted\\nby its supreme effort against Ch‘u. On the other hand, if we choose to disregard the\\ntradition connecting Sun Wu’s name with Ho Lu, it might equally well have seen the\\nlight between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period 482-473, when Yueh was once\\nagain becoming a very serious menace.32 We may feel fairly certain that the author,\\nwhoever he may have been, was not a man of any great eminence in his own day.\\nOn this point the negative testimony of the TSO CHUAN far outweighs any shred of\\nauthority still attaching to the SHIH CHI, if once its other facts are discredited. Sun\\nHsing-yen, however, makes a feeble attempt to explain the omission of his name from\\nthe great commentary. It was Wu Tzu-hsu, he says, who got all the credit of Sun Wu’s\\nexploits, because the latter (being an alien) was not rewarded with an office in the State.\\nHow then did the Sun Tzu legend originate? It may be that the growing celebrity\\nof the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown to its author. It was felt\\nto be only right and proper that one so well versed in the science of war should have\\nsolid achievements to his credit as well. Now the capture of Ying was undoubtedly the\\ngreatest feat of arms in Ho Lu’s reign; it made a deep and lasting impression on all the\\nsurrounding states, and raised Wu to the short-lived zenith of her power. Hence, what\\nmore natural, as time went on, than that the acknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu,\\nshould be popularly identified with that campaign, at first perhaps only in the sense that\\nhis brain conceived and planned it; afterwards, that it was actually carried out by him\\n32There is this to be said for the later period, that the feud would tend to grow more bitter after each\\nencounter, and thus more fully justify the language used in XI. ss. 30.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3350,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"gGjHzeGIP7opSYXrgbGpHOHEd//ra2adMLLs/V9coxY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"7fdbb18b-3791-48a4-8adb-7fa6b529f357":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"7fdbb18b-3791-48a4-8adb-7fa6b529f357\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":16,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_16\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":16,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"s2ouCDN9slopGy649rJrgkpL7ASzxB6MHauArEM87fs=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

With this necessary proviso, I should say that he\\nprobably entered the service of Wu about the time of Ho Lu’s accession, and gathered\\nexperience, though only in the capacity of a subordinate officer, during the intense mil-\\nitary activity which marked the first half of the prince’s reign.34 If he rose to be a gen-\\neral at all, he certainly was never on an equal footing with the three above mentioned.\\nHe was doubtless present at the investment and occupation of Ying, and witnessed Wu’s\\nsudden collapse in the following year. Yueh’s attack at this critical juncture, when her\\nrival was embarrassed on every side, seems to have convinced him that this upstart\\nkingdom was the great enemy against whom every effort would henceforth have to be\\ndirected. Sun Wu was thus a well-seasoned warrior when he sat down to write his\\nfamous book, which according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the end,\\nrather than the beginning of Ho Lu’s reign. The story of the women may possibly have\\ngrown out of some real incident occurring about the same time. As we hear no more\\nof Sun Wu after this from any source, he is hardly likely to have survived his patron\\nor to have taken part in the death-struggle with Yueh, which began with the disaster at\\nTsuili.\\nIf these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain irony in the fate\\nwhich decreed that China’s most illustrious man of peace should be contemporary with\\nher greatest writer on war.\\n1.2 The Text of Sun Tzu\\nI have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzu’s text. The quo-\\ntations that occur in early authors go to show that the \\\"13 chapters\\\" of which Ssu-ma\\nCh‘ien speaks were essentially the same as those now extant. We have his word for it\\nthat they were widely circulated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from\\ndiscussing them on that account. Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface:\\nDuring the Ch‘in and Han dynasties Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR was in\\ngeneral use amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated\\nit as a work of mysterious import, and were unwilling to expound it for the\\nbenefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was the first to write\\na commentary on it.\\nAs we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that Ts‘ao Kung\\ntampered with the text. But the text itself is often so obscure, and the number of edi-\\ntions which appeared from that time onward so great, especially during the T‘ang and\\nSung dynasties, that it would be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed\\n33With Wu Yuan himself the case is just the reverse: – a spurious treatise on war has been fathered on him\\nsimply because he was a great general. Here we have an obvious inducement to forgery. Sun Wu, on the\\nother hand, cannot have been widely known to fame in the 5th century.\\n34From TSO CHUAN: \\\"From the date of King Chao’s accession [515] there was no year in which Ch‘u\\nwas not attacked by Wu.\\\"\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3134,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"6/v43oG4BLw+R/zdm7TdscpM7vRiHSAsEasDv4iBHNc=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2bb2c28c-fb99-4d42-bcee-cece7bd25b94":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2bb2c28c-fb99-4d42-bcee-cece7bd25b94\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":17,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_17\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":17,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LUiuM3TvEmBCg/zd6eizaqzc0vK1NNFQiEkTTJ7I3jw=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

Towards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the chief com-\\nmentaries on Sun Tzu were in existence, a certain Chi T‘ien-pao published a work in\\n15 CHUAN entitled \\\"Sun Tzu with the collected commentaries of ten writers.\\\" There\\nwas another text, with variant readings put forward by Chu Fu of Ta-hsing, which also\\nhad supporters among the scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun Hsing-\\nyen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no longer put into circula-\\ntion. Thus, until the end of the 18th century, the text in sole possession of the field\\nwas one derived from Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition, although no actual copy of that import-\\nant work was known to have survived. That, therefore, is the text of Sun Tzu which\\nappears in the War section of the great Imperial encyclopedia printed in 1726, the KU\\nCHIN T‘U SHU CHI CH‘ENG. Another copy at my disposal of what is practically\\nthe same text, with slight variations, is that contained in the \\\"Eleven philosophers of\\nthe Chou and Ch‘in dynasties\\\" [1758]. And the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop’s\\nfirst edition is evidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese channels.\\nSo things remained until Sun Hsing-yen [1752-1818], a distinguished antiquarian and\\nclassical scholar, who claimed to be an actual descendant of Sun Wu,35 accidentally\\ndiscovered a copy of Chi T‘ien-pao’s long-lost work, when on a visit to the library\\nof the Hua-yin temple.36 Appended to it was the I SHUO of Cheng Yu-Hsien, men-\\ntioned in the T‘UNG CHIH, and also believed to have perished. This is what Sun\\nHsing-yen designates as the \\\"original edition (or text)\\\" – a rather misleading name, for\\nit cannot by any means claim to set before us the text of Sun Tzu in its pristine purity.\\nChi T‘ien-pao was a careless compiler, and appears to have been content to reproduce\\nthe somewhat debased version current in his day, without troubling to collate it with\\nthe earliest editions then available. Fortunately, two versions of Sun Tzu, even older\\nthan the newly discovered work, were still extant, one buried in the T‘UNG TIEN, Tu\\nYu’s great treatise on the Constitution, the other similarly enshrined in the T‘AI P‘ING\\nYU LAN encyclopedia. In both the complete text is to be found, though split up into\\nfragments, intermixed with other matter, and scattered piecemeal over a number of dif-\\nferent sections. Considering that the YU LAN takes us back to the year 983, and the\\nT‘UNG TIEN about 200 years further still, to the middle of the T‘ang dynasty, the\\nvalue of these early transcripts of Sun Tzu can hardly be overestimated. Yet the idea of\\nutilizing them does not seem to have occurred to anyone until Sun Hsing-yen, acting\\nunder Government instructions, undertook a thorough recension of the text. This is his\\nown account:\\nBecause of the numerous mistakes in the text of Sun Tzu which his editors\\nhad handed down, the Government ordered that the ancient edition [of\\nChi T‘ien-pao] should be used, and that the text should be revised and\\ncorrected throughout. It happened that Wu Nien-hu, the Governor Pi Kua,\\nand Hsi, a graduate of the second degree, had all devoted themselves to\\n35Preface ad fin: \\\"My family comes from Lo-an, and we are really descended from Sun Tzu.

As regards the body of the work, each separate sentence is\\nfollowed by a note on the text, if required, and then by the various commentaries apper-\\ntaining to it, arranged in chronological order. These we shall now proceed to discuss\\nbriefly, one by one.\\n1.3 The Commentators\\nSun Tzu can boast an exceptionally long distinguished roll of commentators, which\\nwould do honor to any classic.

TU YU (died 812) did not publish a separate commentary on Sun Tzu, his notes\\nbeing taken from the T‘UNG TIEN, the encyclopedic treatise on the Constitution\\nwhich was his life- work. They are largely repetitions of Ts‘ao Kung and Meng\\nShih, besides which it is believed that he drew on the ancient commentaries of\\nWang Ling and others.

The following short passage by him is\\npreserved in the YU HAI:53\\nSun Wu’s saying, that in war one cannot make certain of conquering,54 is\\nvery different indeed from what other books tell us.55 Wu Ch‘i was a man\\nof the same stamp as Sun Wu: they both wrote books on war, and they\\nare linked together in popular speech as \\\"Sun and Wu.\\\" But Wu Ch‘i’s\\nremarks on war are less weighty, his rules are rougher and more crudely\\nstated, and there is not the same unity of plan as in Sun Tzu’s work, where\\nthe style is terse, but the meaning fully brought out.\\nThe following is an extract from the \\\"Impartial Judgments in the Garden of Literature\\\"\\nby Cheng Hou:\\n46T‘UNG K‘AO, loc. cit.\\n47A notable person in his day.

Her long military annals stretch back\\nto a point at which they are lost in the mists of time. She had built the Great Wall\\nand was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries before the first\\nRoman legionary was seen on the Danube. What with the perpetual collisions of the\\nancient feudal States, the grim conflicts with Huns, Turks and other invaders after the\\ncentralization of government, the terrific upheavals which accompanied the overthrow\\nof so many dynasties, besides the countless rebellions and minor disturbances that have\\nflamed up and flickered out again one by one, it is hardly too much to say that the clash\\nof arms has never ceased to resound in one portion or another of the Empire.\\nNo less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom China can\\npoint with pride. As in all countries, the greatest are fond of emerging at the most\\nfateful crises of her history. Thus, Po Ch‘i stands out conspicuous in the period when\\nCh‘in was entering upon her final struggle with the remaining independent states. The\\nstormy years which followed the break-up of the Ch‘in dynasty are illuminated by\\nthe transcendent genius of Han Hsin. When the House of Han in turn is tottering to\\nits fall, the great and baleful figure of Ts‘ao Ts‘ao dominates the scene. And in the\\nestablishment of the T‘ang dynasty,one of the mightiest tasks achieved by man, the\\nsuperhuman energy of Li Shih-min (afterwards the Emperor T‘ai Tsung) was seconded\\nby the brilliant strategy of Li Ching. None of these generals need fear comparison with\\nthe greatest names in the military history of Europe.\\nIn spite of all this, the great body of Chinese sentiment, from Lao Tzu downwards,\\nand especially as reflected in the standard literature of Confucianism, has been consist-\\nently pacific and intensely opposed to militarism in any form. It is such an uncommon\\nthing to find any of the literati defending warfare on principle, that I have thought it\\nworth while to collect and translate a few passages in which the unorthodox view is\\nupheld.

Every animal with blood in its veins\\nand horns on its head will fight when it is attacked. How much more so\\nwill man, who carries in his breast the faculties of love and hatred, joy and\\nanger! When he is pleased, a feeling of affection springs up within him;\\nwhen angry, his poisoned sting is brought into play. That is the natural law\\nwhich governs his being.... What then shall be said of those scholars of\\nour time, blind to all great issues, and without any appreciation of relat-\\nive values, who can only bark out their stale formulas about \\\"virtue\\\" and\\n\\\"civilization,\\\" condemning the use of military weapons? They will surely\\nbring our country to impotence and dishonor and the loss of her rightful\\nheritage; or, at the very least, they will bring about invasion and rebellion,\\nsacrifice of territory and general enfeeblement. Yet they obstinately refuse\\nto modify the position they have taken up. The truth is that, just as in the\\nfamily the teacher must not spare the rod, and punishments cannot be dis-\\npensed with in the State, so military chastisement can never be allowed to\\nfall into abeyance in the Empire. All one can say is that this power will be\\nexercised wisely by some, foolishly by others, and that among those who\\nbear arms some will be loyal and others rebellious.57\\nThe next piece is taken from Tu Mu’s preface to his commentary on Sun Tzu:\\nWar may be defined as punishment, which is one of the functions of gov-\\nernment. It was the profession of Chung Yu and Jan Ch‘iu, both disciples\\nof Confucius. Nowadays, the holding of trials and hearing of litigation, the\\nimprisonment of offenders and their execution by flogging in the market-\\nplace, are all done by officials. But the wielding of huge armies, the throw-\\ning down of fortified cities, the hauling of women and children into cap-\\ntivity, and the beheading of traitors – this is also work which is done by\\nofficials. The objects of the rack and of military weapons are essentially\\nthe same. There is no intrinsic difference between the punishment of flog-\\nging and cutting off heads in war. For the lesser infractions of law, which\\nare easily dealt with, only a small amount of force need be employed:\\nhence the use of military weapons and wholesale decapitation. In both\\ncases, however, the end in view is to get rid of wicked people, and to give\\ncomfort and relief to the good....\\nChi-sun asked Jan Yu, saying: \\\"Have you, Sir, acquired your military\\naptitude by study, or is it innate?\\\" Jan Yu replied: \\\"It has been acquired\\nby study.\\\"58 \\\"How can that be so,\\\" said Chi-sun, \\\"seeing that you are a\\ndisciple of Confucius?\\\" \\\"It is a fact,\\\" replied Jan Yu; \\\"I was taught by\\nConfucius.

But, at any rate, it has come about that the members of the governing\\nclass are quite afraid of enlarging on military topics, or do so only in a\\nshamefaced manner. If any are bold enough to discuss the subject, they are\\nat once set down as eccentric individuals of coarse and brutal propensities.\\nThis is an extraordinary instance in which, through sheer lack of reasoning,\\nmen unhappily lose sight of fundamental principles.\\nWhen the Duke of Chou was minister under Ch‘eng Wang, he regulated\\nceremonies and made music, and venerated the arts of scholarship and\\nlearning; yet when the barbarians of the River Huai revolted,59 he sallied\\nforth and chastised them. When Confucius held office under the Duke\\nof Lu, and a meeting was convened at Chia-ku,60 he said: \\\"If pacific ne-\\ngotiations are in progress, warlike preparations should have been made\\nbeforehand.\\\" He rebuked and shamed the Marquis of Ch‘i, who cowered\\nunder him and dared not proceed to violence. How can it be said that these\\ntwo great Sages had no knowledge of military matters?\\nWe have seen that the great Chu Hsi held Sun Tzu in high esteem. He also appeals to\\nthe authority of the Classics:\\nOur Master Confucius, answering Duke Ling of Wei, said: \\\"I have never\\nstudied matters connected with armies and battalions.\\\"61 Replying to K‘ung\\nWen-tzu, he said: I have not been instructed about buff-coats and weapons.\\\"\\nBut if we turn to the meeting at Chia-ku, we find that he used armed force\\nagainst the men of Lai, so that the marquis of Ch‘i was overawed. Again,\\nwhen the inhabitants of Pi revolted, the ordered his officers to attack them,\\nwhereupon they were defeated and fled in confusion. He once uttered the\\nwords: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\"62 And Jan Yu also said: \\\"The Sage exercises\\nboth civil and military functions.\\\"63 Can it be a fact that Confucius never\\nstudied or received instruction in the art of war? We can only say that he\\ndid not specially choose matters connected with armies and fighting to be\\nthe subject of his teaching.\\nSun Hsing-yen, the editor of Sun Tzu, writes in similar strain:\\nConfucius said: \\\"I am unversed in military matters.\\\"64 He also said: \\\"If\\nI fight, I conquer.\\\" Confucius ordered ceremonies and regulated music.\\nNow war constitutes one of the five classes of State ceremonial,65 and\\n59See SHU CHING, preface ss. 55.\\n60See SHIH CHI, ch. 47.\\n61Lun Yu, XV. 1.\\n62I failed to trace this utterance.\\n63Supra.\\n64Supra.\\n65The other four being worship, mourning, entertainment of guests, and festive rites.

Hence, the words\\n\\\"I am unversed in\\\" must be taken to mean that there are things which even\\nan inspired Teacher does not know. Those who have to lead an army and\\ndevise stratagems, must learn the art of war. But if one can command\\nthe services of a good general like Sun Tzu, who was employed by Wu\\nTzu-hsu, there is no need to learn it oneself. Hence the remark added by\\nConfucius: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\"\\nThe men of the present day, however, willfully interpret these words of\\nConfucius in their narrowest sense, as though he meant that books on the\\nart of war were not worth reading. With blind persistency, they adduce the\\nexample of Chao Kua, who pored over his father’s books to no purpose,66\\nas a proof that all military theory is useless. Again, seeing that books on\\nwar have to do with such things as opportunism in designing plans, and\\nthe conversion of spies, they hold that the art is immoral and unworthy of\\na sage. These people ignore the fact that the studies of our scholars and\\nthe civil administration of our officials also require steady application and\\npractice before efficiency is reached. The ancients were particularly chary\\nof allowing mere novices to botch their work.67 Weapons are baneful68\\nand fighting perilous; and useless unless a general is in constant practice,\\nhe ought not to hazard other men’s lives in battle.69 Hence it is essential\\nthat Sun Tzu’s 13 chapters should be studied.\\nHsiang Liang used to instruct his nephew Chi70 in the art of war. Chi got\\na rough idea of the art in its general bearings, but would not pursue his\\nstudies to their proper outcome, the consequence being that he was finally\\ndefeated and overthrown. He did not realize that the tricks and artifices\\nof war are beyond verbal computation. Duke Hsiang of Sung and King\\nYen of Hsu were brought to destruction by their misplaced humanity. The\\ntreacherous and underhand nature of war necessitates the use of guile and\\nstratagem suited to the occasion. There is a case on record of Confucius\\nhimself having violated an extorted oath,71 and also of his having left the\\nSung State in disguise.72 Can we then recklessly arraign Sun Tzu for dis-\\nregarding truth and honesty?\\n66See XIII. ss. 11, note.\\n67This is a rather obscure allusion to the TSO CHUAN, where Tzu-ch‘an says: \\\"If you have a piece of\\nbeautiful brocade, you will not employ a mere learner to make it up.\\\"\\n68Cf.

[Ch‘ien Han Shu, ch. 3.] Here,\\nwe are told, the march on Lin-chin was CHENG, and the surprise man-\\neuver was CH‘I.\\\" Chang Yu gives the following summary of opinions on\\nthe words: \\\"Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of\\nCH‘I and CHENG. Wei Liao Tzu [4th cent. B.C.] says: ’Direct warfare\\nfavors frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.’ Ts‘ao Kung\\nsays: ’Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation; appearing on\\nthe enemy’s rear is an indirect maneuver.’ Li Wei-kung [6th and 7th cent.\\nA.D.] says: ’In war, to march straight ahead is CHENG; turning move-\\nments, on the other hand, are CH‘I.’ These writers simply regard CHENG\\nas CHENG, and CH‘I as CH‘I; they do not note that the two are mutually\\ninterchangeable and run into each other like the two sides of a circle [see\\ninfra, ss. 11]. A comment on the T‘ang Emperor T‘ai Tsung goes to the\\nroot of the matter: ’A CH‘I maneuver may be CHENG, if we make the\\nenemy look upon it as CHENG; then our real attack will be CH‘I, and vice\\nversa. The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot\\nfathom our real intent.’\\\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack\\nor other operation is CHENG, on which the enemy has had his attention\\nfixed; whereas that is CH‘I,\\\" which takes him by surprise or comes from\\nan unexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant\\nto be CH‘I,\\\" it immediately becomes CHENG.\\\"]\\n4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an\\negg - this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.\\n5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect\\nmethods will be needed in order to secure victory.\\n[Chang Yu says: \\\"Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding\\nthe enemy’s flanks or falling on his rear.\\\" A brilliant example of \\\"indirect\\ntactics\\\" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord Roberts’ night\\nmarch round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.1\\n6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhausible as Heaven and Earth,\\nunending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they\\nend but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once\\nmore.\\n[Tu Yu and Chang Yu understand this of the permutations of CH‘I and\\nCHENG.\\\" But at present Sun Tzu is not speaking of CHENG at all, un-\\nless, indeed, we suppose with Cheng Yu-hsien that a clause relating to\\nit has fallen out of the text. Of course, as has already been pointed out,\\nthe two are so inextricably interwoven in all military operations, that they\\ncannot really be considered apart.

For instance, \\\"a certain road may be the shortest\\nway for him, but if he knows that it abounds in natural obstacles, or that\\nthe enemy has laid an ambush on it, he will not follow that road.

If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to\\nseize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.\\n[Tu Mu says: \\\"If I wish to extricate myself from a dangerous position, I\\nmust consider not only the enemy’s ability to injure me, but also my own\\nability to gain an advantage over the enemy. If in my counsels these two\\nconsiderations are properly blended, I shall succeed in liberating myself....\\nFor instance; if I am surrounded by the enemy and only think of effecting\\nan escape, the nervelessness of my policy will incite my adversary to pur-\\nsue and crush me; it would be far better to encourage my men to deliver a\\nbold counter-attack, and use the advantage thus gained to free myself from\\nthe enemy’s toils.\\\" See the story of Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, VII. ss. 35, note.]\\n10.

Ssu-ma’s officers came to him and said: \\\"If Meng Ta\\nhas leagued himself with Wu and Shu, the matter should be thoroughly\\ninvestigated before we make a move.\\\" Ssu-ma I replied: \\\"Meng Ta is an\\nunprincipled man, and we ought to go and punish him at once, while he is\\nstill wavering and before he has thrown off the mask.\\\" Then, by a series of\\nforced marches, be brought his army under the walls of Hsin-ch‘eng with\\nin a space of eight days. Now Meng Ta had previously said in a letter to\\nChu-ko Liang: \\\"Wan is 1200 LI from here. When the news of my revolt\\nreaches Ssu-ma I, he will at once inform his imperial master, but it will be\\na whole month before any steps can be taken, and by that time my city will\\nbe well fortified. Besides, Ssu-ma I is sure not to come himself, and the\\ngenerals that will be sent against us are not worth troubling about.\\\" The\\nnext letter, however, was filled with consternation: \\\"Though only eight\\ndays have passed since I threw off my allegiance, an army is already at\\nthe city-gates.

Though it is impossible to account for the\\npresent state of Sun Tzu’s text, a few suggestive facts maybe brought into\\nprominence: (1) Chap.

The story runs thus in the HOU HAN SHU, ch. 47: \\\"When Pan\\nCh‘ao arrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the country, received him\\nat first with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards his be-\\nhavior underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss and negligent.\\nPan Ch‘ao spoke about this to the officers of his suite: ’Have you no-\\nticed,’ he said, ’that Kuang’s polite intentions are on the wane? This must\\nsignify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians, and that con-\\nsequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with which side to\\nthrow in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly wise man, we are\\ntold, can perceive things before they have come to pass; how much more,\\nthen, those that are already manifest!’ Thereupon he called one of the nat-\\nives who had been assigned to his service, and set a trap for him, saying:\\n’Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu who arrived some day ago?’\\nThe man was so taken aback that between surprise and fear he presently\\nblurted out the whole truth. Pan Ch‘ao, keeping his informant carefully\\nunder lock and key, then summoned a general gathering of his officers,\\nthirty-six in all, and began drinking with them. When the wine had moun-\\nted into their heads a little, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by\\naddressing them thus: ’Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated\\nregion, anxious to achieve riches and honor by some great exploit. Now it\\nhappens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom\\nonly a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy extended\\ntowards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this envoy prevail\\nupon him to seize our party and hand us over to the Hsiung-no, our bones\\nwill become food for the wolves of the desert. What are we to do?’ With\\none accord, the officers replied: ’Standing as we do in peril of our lives,\\nwe will follow our commander through life and death.’ For the sequel of\\nthis adventure, see chap. XII. ss. 1, note.]\\n52. We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are ac-\\nquainted with their designs.

To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not\\nbefit a warlike prince.\\n54. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows it-\\nself in preventing the concentration of the enemy’s forces. He overawes\\nhis opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.\\n[Mei Tao-ch‘en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so much\\naffected by the Chinese: \\\"In attacking a powerful state, if you can divide\\nher forces, you will have a superiority in strength; if you have a superi-\\nority in strength, you will overawe the enemy; if you overawe the enemy,\\nthe neighboring states will be frightened; and if the neighboring states are\\nfrightened, the enemy’s allies will be prevented from joining her.\\\" The fol-\\nlowing gives a stronger meaning: \\\"If the great state has once been defeated\\n(before she has had time to summon her allies), then the lesser states will\\nhold aloof and refrain from massing their forces.\\\" Ch‘en Hao and Chang\\nYu take the sentence in quite another way. The former says: \\\"Powerful\\nthough a prince may be, if he attacks a large state, he will be unable to\\nraise enough troops, and must rely to some extent on external aid; if he\\ndispenses with this, and with overweening confidence in his own strength,\\nsimply tries to intimidate the enemy, he will surely be defeated.\\\" Chang Yu\\nputs his view thus: \\\"If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people\\nwill be discontented and hang back. But if (as will then be the case) our\\ndisplay of military force is inferior by half to that of the enemy, the other\\nchieftains will take fright and refuse to join us.\\\"]\\n55. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he\\nfoster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs,\\nkeeping his antagonists in awe.\\n[The train of thought, as said by Li Ch‘uan, appears to be this: Secure\\nagainst a combination of his enemies, \\\"he can afford to reject entangling\\nalliances and simply pursue his own secret designs, his prestige enable him\\nto dispense with external friendships.\\\"]\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2959,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"rimjg1Hb9nJMws/AcLQJnuyCk3szqHXHXn9Osoj24VI=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e537b32e-3769-407d-884f-d86540ffa6b7":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e537b32e-3769-407d-884f-d86540ffa6b7\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":111,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_111\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":111,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"QtUL8NcgAd7+blyLZopuh4LK06g3CS0w0mPC8fkwN5M=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 12.

THE NINE SITUATIONS 111\\n[These words of Sun Tzu were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation\\nof the tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already al-\\nluded to on p. 28. In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao,\\nand halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the\\nenemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body\\nof 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red flag.\\nTheir instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles and keep\\na secret watch on the enemy. \\\"When the men of Chao see me in full flight,\\\"\\nHan Hsin said, \\\"they will abandon their fortifications and give chase. This\\nmust be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down the Chao standards and\\nset up the red banners of Han in their stead.\\\" Turning then to his other\\nofficers, he remarked: \\\"Our adversary holds a strong position, and is not\\nlikely to come out and attack us until he sees the standard and drums of\\nthe commander-in-chief, for fear I should turn back and escape through\\nthe mountains.\\\" So saying, he first of all sent out a division consisting of\\n10,000 men, and ordered them to form in line of battle with their backs to\\nthe River Ti. Seeing this maneuver, the whole army of Chao broke into\\nloud laughter. By this time it was broad daylight, and Han Hsin, display-\\ning the generalissimo’s flag, marched out of the pass with drums beating,\\nand was immediately engaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, last-\\ning for some time; until at length Han Hsin and his colleague Chang Ni,\\nleaving drums and banner on the field, fled to the division on the river\\nbank, where another fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to\\npursue them and to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of\\nmen; but the two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was\\nfighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the 2000\\nhorsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men of Chao fol-\\nlowing up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls, tore\\nup the enemy’s flags and replaced them by those of Han. When the Chao\\narmy looked back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags struck them\\nwith terror. Convinced that the Hans had got in and overpowered their\\nking, they broke up in wild disorder, every effort of their leader to stay\\nthe panic being in vain. Then the Han army fell on them from both sides\\nand completed the rout, killing a number and capturing the rest, amongst\\nwhom was King Ya himself.... After the battle, some of Han Hsin’s of-\\nficers came to him and said: \\\"In the ART OF WAR we are told to have\\na hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a river or marsh on the left front.\\n[This appears to be a blend of Sun Tzu and T‘ai Kung.

His suggestion is, that\\nthe Hsia and Yin dynasties were upset owing to the intimate knowledge\\nof their weaknesses and shortcoming which these former ministers were\\nable to impart to the other side. Mei Yao-ch‘en appears to resent any such\\naspersion on these historic names: \\\"I Yin and Lu Ya,\\\" he says, \\\"were not\\nrebels against the Government. Hsia could not employ the former, hence\\nYin employed him. Yin could not employ the latter, hence Hou employed\\nhim. Their great achievements were all for the good of the people.\\\" Ho\\nShih is also indignant: \\\"How should two divinely inspired men such as I\\nand Lu have acted as common spies? Sun Tzu’s mention of them simply\\nmeans that the proper use of the five classes of spies is a matter which\\nrequires men of the highest mental caliber like I and Lu, whose wisdom\\nand capacity qualified them for the task. The above words only emphasize\\nthis point.\\\" Ho Shih believes then that the two heroes are mentioned on\\naccount of their supposed skill in the use of spies. But this is very weak.]\\n27.

We increased our holdings in all five last year after Greg Abel\\nand I made a trip to Tokyo to talk with their managements.\\nBerkshire now owns about 9% of each of the five. (A minor point: Japanese companies\\ncalculate outstanding shares in a manner different from the practice in the U.S.) Berkshire has also\\npledged to each company that it will not purchase shares that will take our holdings beyond 9.9%.\\nOur cost for the five totals ¥1.6 trillion, and the yearend market value of the five was ¥2.9 trillion.\\nHowever, the yen has weakened in recent years and our yearend unrealized gain in dollars was\\n61% or $8 billion.\\nNeither Greg nor I believe we can forecast market prices of major currencies. We also don’t\\nbelieve we can hire anyone with this ability. Therefore, Berkshire has financed most of its Japanese\\nposition with the proceeds from ¥1.3 trillion of bonds. This debt has been very well-received in\\nJapan, and I believe Berkshire has more yen-denominated debt outstanding than any other\\nAmerican company. The weakened yen has produced a yearend gain for Berkshire of $1.9 billion,\\na sum that, pursuant to GAAP rules, has periodically been recognized in income over the\\n2020-23 period.\\nIn certain important ways, all five companies – Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and\\nSumitomo – follow shareholder-friendly policies that are much superior to those customarily\\npracticed in the U.S. Since we began our Japanese purchases, each of the five has reduced the\\nnumber of its outstanding shares at attractive prices.\\n10\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"dnMvGqmOoPJWtzmiqNM5jQxthhNi/XXuEEkDtokWQaA=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864549991-berkshire.pdf_10":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864549991-berkshire.pdf_10\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Meanwhile, the managements of all five companies have been far less aggressive about\\ntheir own compensation than is typical in the United States.

I erred, however, in my expectations for both BNSF\\nand BHE. Let’s take a look at each.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nRail is essential to America’s economic future. It is clearly the most efficient\\nway – measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity – of moving heavy materials to distant\\ndestinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must travel to\\ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can’t run without\\nrail, and the industry’s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American\\nbusinesses, railroads eat capital.\\nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad\\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted\\nother fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least\\n$500 billion to replicate those assets and decades to complete the job.\\nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain its present\\nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested,\\nbut it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries.\\nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years\\nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $1 1⁄2 billion annually. Ouch! That sort of\\ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall considerably short of\\nBNSF’s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad’s debt. And that we do not\\nintend to do.\\nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less\\nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That’s no\\nsurprise to me or Berkshire’s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a\\nsmall fraction of its replacement value.\\nNorth America’s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and\\nexported goods, etc. one-way for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for\\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization\\nof track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I\\nsit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees\\nworking under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions.\\nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the\\ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must\\ndeal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or\\nmentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car,\\nextraordinarily heavy train that can’t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be\\nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more\\ncommon in Europe and will always be with us.\\n12\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"Xy6vnfws7l56uedLnAt0O664e/geI6MI6W51+GmJckw=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864549991-berkshire.pdf_12":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864549991-berkshire.pdf_12\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Wage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and\\nCongress.

The words “common carrier” define\\nrailroad responsibilities.\\nLast year BNSF’s earnings declined more than I expected, as revenues fell. Though fuel\\ncosts also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country’s inflation\\ngoals. This differential may recur in future negotiations.\\nThough BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five\\nsince our purchase. I believe that our vast service territory is second to none and that therefore our\\nmargin comparisons can and should improve.\\nI am particularly proud of both BNSF’s contribution to the country and the people who\\nwork in sub-zero outdoor jobs in North Dakota and Montana winters to keep America’s\\ncommercial arteries open. Railroads don’t get much attention when they are working but, were\\nthey unavailable, the void would be noticed immediately throughout America.\\nA century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of\\nBerkshire. You can count on that.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last year occurred at BHE. Most\\nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as\\nexpected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or\\neven bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California’s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii).\\nIn such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once\\nregarded as among the most stable industries in America.\\nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through\\na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior\\nperformance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely\\nbe required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that\\nutilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE’s\\nextensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some\\nyears from completion. Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the\\ncontinental United States.\\nWith this model employed by both private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on,\\neven if population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The “margin of safety”\\napproach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactory-\\nreturn pact has been broken in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such\\nruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground transmission may be\\nrequired but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay the staggering costs for such construction?\\n13\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"xfuaVWSMuglvzPmAzHKKCmgdKL7/qj+qZUZVbvaCwao=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864549991-berkshire.pdf_13":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864549991-berkshire.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"At Berkshire, we have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred.\\nThese costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have increased – and will likely\\ncontinue to increase – if convective storms become more frequent.\\nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s forest-fire losses and can\\nintelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western\\nstates. It remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere.\\nOther electric utilities may face survival problems resembling those of Pacific Gas and\\nElectric and Hawaiian Electric. A confiscatory resolution of our present problems would obviously\\nbe a negative for BHE, but both that company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive\\nnegative surprises. We regularly get these in our insurance business, where our basic product is\\nrisk assumption, and they will occur elsewhere. Berkshire can sustain financial surprises but we\\nwill not knowingly throw good money after bad.\\nWhatever the case at Berkshire, the final result for the utility industry may be ominous:\\nCertain utilities might no longer attract the savings of American citizens and will be forced to\\nadopt the public-power model.

Consequently, it was not until 1959 when he was 35 that I first met him.\\nIn 1962, he decided that he should take up money management.\\nThree years later he told me – correctly! – that I had made a dumb decision in\\nbuying control of Berkshire. But, he assured me, since I had already made the move,\\nhe would tell me how to correct my mistake.\\nIn what I next relate, bear in mind that Charlie and his family did not have a\\ndime invested in the small investing partnership that I was then managing and whose\\nmoney I had used for the Berkshire purchase. Moreover, neither of us expected that\\nCharlie would ever own a share of Berkshire stock.\\nNevertheless, Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: “Warren, forget about\\never buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add\\nto it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses\\nat wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero,\\nBen Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.” With much back-sliding\\nI subsequently followed his instructions.\\nMany years later, Charlie became my partner in running Berkshire and,\\nrepeatedly, jerked me back to sanity when my old habits surfaced. Until his death, he\\ncontinued in this role and together we, along with those who early on invested with\\nus, ended up far better off than Charlie and I had ever dreamed possible.\\nIn reality, Charlie was the “architect” of the present Berkshire, and I acted as\\nthe “general contractor” to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision.\\nCharlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me\\ntake the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part\\nolder brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the\\nreins, and when I blundered he never – never –reminded me of my mistake.\\nIn the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those\\nwho had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten. Berkshire\\nhas become a great company. Though I have long been in charge of the construction\\ncrew; Charlie should forever be credited with being the architect.\\n2\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2412,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"wxgYL2y4t3hdUaPHmG704fWMeEe9lPCBpO//rV/Bedc=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"72d6017c-ef03-4bcf-a261-23551e8f1cc1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"72d6017c-ef03-4bcf-a261-23551e8f1cc1\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864549991-berkshire.pdf_2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"nt+Y71vcMQDRFKMDEnDKFr4ITU5C4vNGRQmt2N5lloo=\"}},\"text\":\"BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\\nBerkshire has more than three million shareholder accounts.

He and\\nI were of one mind regarding our responsibilities to Berkshire shareholders.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nWriters find it useful to picture the reader they seek, and often they are hoping to attract a\\nmass audience. At Berkshire, we have a more limited target: investors who trust Berkshire with\\ntheir savings without any expectation of resale (resembling in attitude people who save in order to\\nbuy a farm or rental property rather than people who prefer using their excess funds to purchase\\nlottery tickets or “hot” stocks).\\nOver the years, Berkshire has attracted an unusual number of such “lifetime” shareholders\\nand their heirs. We cherish their presence and believe they are entitled to hear every year both the\\ngood and bad news, delivered directly from their CEO and not from an investor-relations officer\\nor communications consultant forever serving up optimism and syrupy mush.\\nIn visualizing the owners that Berkshire seeks, I am lucky to have the perfect mental model,\\nmy sister, Bertie. Let me introduce her.\\nFor openers, Bertie is smart, wise and likes to challenge my thinking. We have never,\\nhowever, had a shouting match or anything close to a ruptured relationship. We never will.\\nFurthermore, Bertie, and her three daughters as well, have a large portion of their savings\\nin Berkshire shares. Their ownership spans decades, and every year Bertie will read what I have\\nto say.

She follows business news – reading four newspapers daily – but doesn’t consider\\nherself an economic expert. She is sensible – very sensible – instinctively knowing that pundits\\nshould always be ignored. After all, if she could reliably predict tomorrow’s winners, would she\\nfreely share her valuable insights and thereby increase competitive buying? That would be like\\nfinding gold and then handing a map to the neighbors showing its location.\\nBertie understands the power – for good or bad – of incentives, the weaknesses of humans,\\nthe “tells” that can be recognized when observing human behavior. She knows who is “selling”\\nand who can be trusted. In short, she is nobody’s fool.\\nSo, what would interest Bertie this year?\\nOperating Results, Fact and Fiction\\nLet’s begin with the numbers. The official annual report begins on K-1 and extends for 124\\npages. It is filled with a vast amount of information – some important, some trivial.\\nAmong its disclosures many owners, along with financial reporters, will focus on page\\nK-72. There, they will find the proverbial “bottom line” labeled “Net earnings (loss).” The\\nnumbers read $90 billion for 2021, ($23 billion) for 2022 and $96 billion for 2023.\\nWhat in the world is going on?\\nYou seek guidance and are told that the procedures for calculating these “earnings” are\\npromulgated by a sober and credentialed Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”),\\nmandated by a dedicated and hard-working Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and\\naudited by the world-class professionals at Deloitte & Touche (“D&T”). On page K-67, D&T pulls\\nno punches: “In our opinion, the financial statements . . . . . present fairly, in all material respects\\n(italics mine), the financial position of the Company . . . . . and the results of its operations . . . . .\\nfor each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 . . . . .”\\nSo sanctified, this worse-than-useless “net income” figure quickly gets transmitted\\nthroughout the world via the internet and media.

I erred, however, in my expectations for both BNSF\\nand BHE. Let’s take a look at each.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nRail is essential to America’s economic future. It is clearly the most efficient\\nway – measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity – of moving heavy materials to distant\\ndestinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must travel to\\ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can’t run without\\nrail, and the industry’s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American\\nbusinesses, railroads eat capital.\\nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad\\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted\\nother fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least\\n$500 billion to replicate those assets and decades to complete the job.\\nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain its present\\nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested,\\nbut it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries.\\nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years\\nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $1 1⁄2 billion annually. Ouch! That sort of\\ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall considerably short of\\nBNSF’s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad’s debt. And that we do not\\nintend to do.\\nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less\\nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That’s no\\nsurprise to me or Berkshire’s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a\\nsmall fraction of its replacement value.\\nNorth America’s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and\\nexported goods, etc. one-way for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for\\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization\\nof track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I\\nsit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees\\nworking under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions.\\nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the\\ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must\\ndeal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or\\nmentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car,\\nextraordinarily heavy train that can’t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be\\nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more\\ncommon in Europe and will always be with us.\\n12\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3108,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"5FgHNSxwNMBYvtmOESY6J6D48QKFaJTArBhmSytQuhM=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b1d9f414-af1a-47fe-bb35-f41bdc116279":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b1d9f414-af1a-47fe-bb35-f41bdc116279\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864549991-berkshire.pdf_12\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"xfuaVWSMuglvzPmAzHKKCmgdKL7/qj+qZUZVbvaCwao=\"}},\"text\":\"Wage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and\\nCongress. Additionally, American railroads are required to carry many dangerous products every\\nday that the industry would much rather avoid. The words “common carrier” define\\nrailroad responsibilities.\\nLast year BNSF’s earnings declined more than I expected, as revenues fell. Though fuel\\ncosts also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country’s inflation\\ngoals. This differential may recur in future negotiations.\\nThough BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five\\nsince our purchase. I believe that our vast service territory is second to none and that therefore our\\nmargin comparisons can and should improve.\\nI am particularly proud of both BNSF’s contribution to the country and the people who\\nwork in sub-zero outdoor jobs in North Dakota and Montana winters to keep America’s\\ncommercial arteries open. Railroads don’t get much attention when they are working but, were\\nthey unavailable, the void would be noticed immediately throughout America.\\nA century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of\\nBerkshire. You can count on that.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last year occurred at BHE. Most\\nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as\\nexpected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or\\neven bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California’s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii).\\nIn such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once\\nregarded as among the most stable industries in America.\\nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through\\na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior\\nperformance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely\\nbe required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that\\nutilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE’s\\nextensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some\\nyears from completion. Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the\\ncontinental United States.\\nWith this model employed by both private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on,\\neven if population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The “margin of safety”\\napproach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactory-\\nreturn pact has been broken in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such\\nruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground transmission may be\\nrequired but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay the staggering costs for such construction?\\n13\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3148,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"be+8KtU2NI53JPc+i0kEMoF8pXAGPEctHJ0bwLSKgzM=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4ed4c059-f7de-4514-acf2-1266e33b8d97":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4ed4c059-f7de-4514-acf2-1266e33b8d97\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864549991-berkshire.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"V91WeTvEwVsHIIef55c1DJVVe1TVNVqlRejhHyeOLbY=\"}},\"text\":\"At Berkshire, we have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred.\\nThese costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have increased – and will likely\\ncontinue to increase – if convective storms become more frequent.\\nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s forest-fire losses and can\\nintelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western\\nstates. It remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere.\\nOther electric utilities may face survival problems resembling those of Pacific Gas and\\nElectric and Hawaiian Electric. A confiscatory resolution of our present problems would obviously\\nbe a negative for BHE, but both that company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive\\nnegative surprises. We regularly get these in our insurance business, where our basic product is\\nrisk assumption, and they will occur elsewhere. Berkshire can sustain financial surprises but we\\nwill not knowingly throw good money after bad.\\nWhatever the case at Berkshire, the final result for the utility industry may be ominous:\\nCertain utilities might no longer attract the savings of American citizens and will be forced to\\nadopt the public-power model. Nebraska made this choice in the 1930s and there are many\\npublic-power operations throughout the country. Eventually, voters, taxpayers and users will\\ndecide which model they prefer.\\nWhen the dust settles, America’s power needs and the consequent capital expenditure will\\nbe staggering. I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns\\nand, along with Berkshire’s two partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nEnough about problems: Our insurance business performed exceptionally well last year,\\nsetting records in sales, float and underwriting profits. Property-casualty insurance (“P/C”)\\nprovides the core of Berkshire’s well-being and growth. We have been in the business for 57 years\\nand despite our nearly 5,000-fold increase in volume – from $17 million to $83 billion – we have\\nmuch room to grow.\\nBeyond that, we have learned – too often, painfully – a good deal about what types of\\ninsurance business and what sort of people to avoid. The most important lesson is that our\\nunderwriters can be thin, fat, male, female, young, old, foreign or domestic. But they can’t be\\noptimists at the office, however desirable that quality may generally be in life.\\nSurprises in the P/C business – which can occur decades after six-month or one-year\\npolicies have expired – are almost always negative. The industry’s accounting is designed to\\nrecognize this reality, but estimation mistakes can be huge. And when charlatans are involved,\\ndetection is often both slow and costly. Berkshire will always attempt to be accurate in its estimates\\nof future loss payments but inflation – both monetary and the “legal” variety – is a wild card.\\n14\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2972,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"pZhi7F3Ukano7XUtqwQoDhT2jofTVsg2y193ZcCh1ro=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"7c4fcb10-b647-417f-b9c0-2a2517df8e9b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"7c4fcb10-b647-417f-b9c0-2a2517df8e9b\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864549991-berkshire.pdf_14\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"h3mzE1rDsm3e/ql8c0XkQhxSwnoMtTC9cWc/goOEHxg=\"}},\"text\":\"I’ve told the story of our insurance operations so many times that I will simply direct\\nnewcomers to page 18.

In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero,\\nBen Graham.

On page K-67, D&T pulls\\nno punches: “In our opinion, the financial statements . . . . . present fairly, in all material respects\\n(italics mine), the financial position of the Company . . . . . and the results of its operations . . . . .\\nfor each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 . . . . .”\\nSo sanctified, this worse-than-useless “net income” figure quickly gets transmitted\\nthroughout the world via the internet and media.

At Berkshire, our view is that “earnings” should be a\\nsensible concept that Bertie will find somewhat useful – but only as a starting point – in\\nevaluating a business.

Why else would\\nwe commit huge dollar amounts of your money (and Bertie’s) to marketable equities just as I have\\nbeen doing with my own funds throughout my investing lifetime?\\nI can’t remember a period since March 11, 1942 – the date of my first stock purchase – that\\nI have not had a majority of my net worth in equities, U.S.-based equities.

We particularly like its vast oil\\nand gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though\\nthe economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven. Both of these activities are very\\nmuch in our country’s interest.\\nNot so long ago, the U.S. was woefully dependent on foreign oil, and carbon capture had\\nno meaningful constituency. Indeed, in 1975, U.S. production was eight million barrels of\\noil-equivalent per day (“BOEPD”), a level far short of the country’s needs. From the favorable\\nenergy position that facilitated the U.S. mobilization in World War II, the country had retreated to\\nbecome heavily dependent on foreign – potentially unstable – suppliers. Further declines in oil\\nproduction were predicted along with future increases in usage.\\n9\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"qlUI7Y5JeZzOaMu/mpqkUoOFiL1TeMINuYKljP4QRA4=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_9":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"For a long time, the pessimism appeared to be correct, with production falling to five\\nmillion BOEPD by 2007.

We increased our holdings in all five last year after Greg Abel\\nand I made a trip to Tokyo to talk with their managements.\\nBerkshire now owns about 9% of each of the five. (A minor point: Japanese companies\\ncalculate outstanding shares in a manner different from the practice in the U.S.) Berkshire has also\\npledged to each company that it will not purchase shares that will take our holdings beyond 9.9%.\\nOur cost for the five totals ¥1.6 trillion, and the yearend market value of the five was ¥2.9 trillion.\\nHowever, the yen has weakened in recent years and our yearend unrealized gain in dollars was\\n61% or $8 billion.\\nNeither Greg nor I believe we can forecast market prices of major currencies. We also don’t\\nbelieve we can hire anyone with this ability. Therefore, Berkshire has financed most of its Japanese\\nposition with the proceeds from ¥1.3 trillion of bonds. This debt has been very well-received in\\nJapan, and I believe Berkshire has more yen-denominated debt outstanding than any other\\nAmerican company. The weakened yen has produced a yearend gain for Berkshire of $1.9 billion,\\na sum that, pursuant to GAAP rules, has periodically been recognized in income over the\\n2020-23 period.\\nIn certain important ways, all five companies – Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and\\nSumitomo – follow shareholder-friendly policies that are much superior to those customarily\\npracticed in the U.S. Since we began our Japanese purchases, each of the five has reduced the\\nnumber of its outstanding shares at attractive prices.\\n10\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"7MFbeDGhCpjEdUp6oEc40PKNsySfkZjN41Q3fw0zvRc=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_10":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_10\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Meanwhile, the managements of all five companies have been far less aggressive about\\ntheir own compensation than is typical in the United States.

I erred, however, in my expectations for both BNSF\\nand BHE. Let’s take a look at each.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nRail is essential to America’s economic future. It is clearly the most efficient\\nway – measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity – of moving heavy materials to distant\\ndestinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must travel to\\ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can’t run without\\nrail, and the industry’s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American\\nbusinesses, railroads eat capital.\\nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad\\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted\\nother fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least\\n$500 billion to replicate those assets and decades to complete the job.\\nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain its present\\nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested,\\nbut it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries.\\nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years\\nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $1 1⁄2 billion annually. Ouch! That sort of\\ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall considerably short of\\nBNSF’s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad’s debt. And that we do not\\nintend to do.\\nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less\\nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That’s no\\nsurprise to me or Berkshire’s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a\\nsmall fraction of its replacement value.\\nNorth America’s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and\\nexported goods, etc. one-way for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for\\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization\\nof track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I\\nsit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees\\nworking under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions.\\nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the\\ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must\\ndeal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or\\nmentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car,\\nextraordinarily heavy train that can’t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be\\nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more\\ncommon in Europe and will always be with us.\\n12\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"bU0mFwmwKpKYDVuYW0GuTaqYmxEnhI1Kwz7lMrUCp3s=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_12":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_12\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Wage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and\\nCongress.

Though fuel\\ncosts also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country’s inflation\\ngoals. This differential may recur in future negotiations.\\nThough BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five\\nsince our purchase. I believe that our vast service territory is second to none and that therefore our\\nmargin comparisons can and should improve.\\nI am particularly proud of both BNSF’s contribution to the country and the people who\\nwork in sub-zero outdoor jobs in North Dakota and Montana winters to keep America’s\\ncommercial arteries open. Railroads don’t get much attention when they are working but, were\\nthey unavailable, the void would be noticed immediately throughout America.\\nA century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of\\nBerkshire. You can count on that.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last year occurred at BHE. Most\\nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as\\nexpected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or\\neven bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California’s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii).\\nIn such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once\\nregarded as among the most stable industries in America.\\nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through\\na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior\\nperformance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely\\nbe required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that\\nutilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE’s\\nextensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some\\nyears from completion. Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the\\ncontinental United States.\\nWith this model employed by both private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on,\\neven if population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The “margin of safety”\\napproach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactory-\\nreturn pact has been broken in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such\\nruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground transmission may be\\nrequired but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay the staggering costs for such construction?\\n13\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"xvFfD2wX2+s6ljyB/zqxfjf5cASLXSEruVpGPl5TNJI=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_13":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"At Berkshire, we have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred.\\nThese costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have increased – and will likely\\ncontinue to increase – if convective storms become more frequent.\\nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s forest-fire losses and can\\nintelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western\\nstates.

A confiscatory resolution of our present problems would obviously\\nbe a negative for BHE, but both that company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive\\nnegative surprises.

Consequently, it was not until 1959 when he was 35 that I first met him.\\nIn 1962, he decided that he should take up money management.\\nThree years later he told me – correctly! – that I had made a dumb decision in\\nbuying control of Berkshire. But, he assured me, since I had already made the move,\\nhe would tell me how to correct my mistake.\\nIn what I next relate, bear in mind that Charlie and his family did not have a\\ndime invested in the small investing partnership that I was then managing and whose\\nmoney I had used for the Berkshire purchase. Moreover, neither of us expected that\\nCharlie would ever own a share of Berkshire stock.\\nNevertheless, Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: “Warren, forget about\\never buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add\\nto it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses\\nat wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero,\\nBen Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.” With much back-sliding\\nI subsequently followed his instructions.\\nMany years later, Charlie became my partner in running Berkshire and,\\nrepeatedly, jerked me back to sanity when my old habits surfaced. Until his death, he\\ncontinued in this role and together we, along with those who early on invested with\\nus, ended up far better off than Charlie and I had ever dreamed possible.\\nIn reality, Charlie was the “architect” of the present Berkshire, and I acted as\\nthe “general contractor” to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision.\\nCharlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me\\ntake the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part\\nolder brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the\\nreins, and when I blundered he never – never –reminded me of my mistake.\\nIn the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those\\nwho had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten. Berkshire\\nhas become a great company. Though I have long been in charge of the construction\\ncrew; Charlie should forever be credited with being the architect.\\n2\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2412,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"BT2bZdvP9Dk1jYPgv5BfX6N5Es5Flz2HHnBFcnKFzlE=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6a83d9b0-0c52-4dbb-b63b-a599fe9bb447":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6a83d9b0-0c52-4dbb-b63b-a599fe9bb447\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"jVoW/S+9KZrAs5HmW32aUugUkOi0ladPSE/aIfpCMCE=\"}},\"text\":\"BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\\nBerkshire has more than three million shareholder accounts.

He and\\nI were of one mind regarding our responsibilities to Berkshire shareholders.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nWriters find it useful to picture the reader they seek, and often they are hoping to attract a\\nmass audience. At Berkshire, we have a more limited target: investors who trust Berkshire with\\ntheir savings without any expectation of resale (resembling in attitude people who save in order to\\nbuy a farm or rental property rather than people who prefer using their excess funds to purchase\\nlottery tickets or “hot” stocks).\\nOver the years, Berkshire has attracted an unusual number of such “lifetime” shareholders\\nand their heirs. We cherish their presence and believe they are entitled to hear every year both the\\ngood and bad news, delivered directly from their CEO and not from an investor-relations officer\\nor communications consultant forever serving up optimism and syrupy mush.\\nIn visualizing the owners that Berkshire seeks, I am lucky to have the perfect mental model,\\nmy sister, Bertie. Let me introduce her.\\nFor openers, Bertie is smart, wise and likes to challenge my thinking. We have never,\\nhowever, had a shouting match or anything close to a ruptured relationship. We never will.\\nFurthermore, Bertie, and her three daughters as well, have a large portion of their savings\\nin Berkshire shares. Their ownership spans decades, and every year Bertie will read what I have\\nto say.

She follows business news – reading four newspapers daily – but doesn’t consider\\nherself an economic expert. She is sensible – very sensible – instinctively knowing that pundits\\nshould always be ignored. After all, if she could reliably predict tomorrow’s winners, would she\\nfreely share her valuable insights and thereby increase competitive buying? That would be like\\nfinding gold and then handing a map to the neighbors showing its location.\\nBertie understands the power – for good or bad – of incentives, the weaknesses of humans,\\nthe “tells” that can be recognized when observing human behavior. She knows who is “selling”\\nand who can be trusted. In short, she is nobody’s fool.\\nSo, what would interest Bertie this year?\\nOperating Results, Fact and Fiction\\nLet’s begin with the numbers. The official annual report begins on K-1 and extends for 124\\npages. It is filled with a vast amount of information – some important, some trivial.\\nAmong its disclosures many owners, along with financial reporters, will focus on page\\nK-72. There, they will find the proverbial “bottom line” labeled “Net earnings (loss).” The\\nnumbers read $90 billion for 2021, ($23 billion) for 2022 and $96 billion for 2023.\\nWhat in the world is going on?\\nYou seek guidance and are told that the procedures for calculating these “earnings” are\\npromulgated by a sober and credentialed Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”),\\nmandated by a dedicated and hard-working Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and\\naudited by the world-class professionals at Deloitte & Touche (“D&T”). On page K-67, D&T pulls\\nno punches: “In our opinion, the financial statements . . . . . present fairly, in all material respects\\n(italics mine), the financial position of the Company . . . . . and the results of its operations . . . . .\\nfor each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 . . . . .”\\nSo sanctified, this worse-than-useless “net income” figure quickly gets transmitted\\nthroughout the world via the internet and media.

I erred, however, in my expectations for both BNSF\\nand BHE. Let’s take a look at each.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nRail is essential to America’s economic future. It is clearly the most efficient\\nway – measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity – of moving heavy materials to distant\\ndestinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must travel to\\ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can’t run without\\nrail, and the industry’s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American\\nbusinesses, railroads eat capital.\\nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad\\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted\\nother fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least\\n$500 billion to replicate those assets and decades to complete the job.\\nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain its present\\nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested,\\nbut it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries.\\nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years\\nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $1 1⁄2 billion annually. Ouch! That sort of\\ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall considerably short of\\nBNSF’s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad’s debt. And that we do not\\nintend to do.\\nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less\\nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That’s no\\nsurprise to me or Berkshire’s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a\\nsmall fraction of its replacement value.\\nNorth America’s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and\\nexported goods, etc. one-way for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for\\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization\\nof track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I\\nsit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees\\nworking under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions.\\nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the\\ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must\\ndeal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or\\nmentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car,\\nextraordinarily heavy train that can’t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be\\nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more\\ncommon in Europe and will always be with us.\\n12\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3108,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"lM9D3OAyIwEBz6MnZA4MCPCefjAfzZcb0kFgYGsmRiw=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"1cc6aac2-caa5-4104-8a7c-46d0a5bc851d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"1cc6aac2-caa5-4104-8a7c-46d0a5bc851d\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_12\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"xvFfD2wX2+s6ljyB/zqxfjf5cASLXSEruVpGPl5TNJI=\"}},\"text\":\"Wage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and\\nCongress. Additionally, American railroads are required to carry many dangerous products every\\nday that the industry would much rather avoid. The words “common carrier” define\\nrailroad responsibilities.\\nLast year BNSF’s earnings declined more than I expected, as revenues fell. Though fuel\\ncosts also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country’s inflation\\ngoals. This differential may recur in future negotiations.\\nThough BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five\\nsince our purchase. I believe that our vast service territory is second to none and that therefore our\\nmargin comparisons can and should improve.\\nI am particularly proud of both BNSF’s contribution to the country and the people who\\nwork in sub-zero outdoor jobs in North Dakota and Montana winters to keep America’s\\ncommercial arteries open. Railroads don’t get much attention when they are working but, were\\nthey unavailable, the void would be noticed immediately throughout America.\\nA century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of\\nBerkshire. You can count on that.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last year occurred at BHE. Most\\nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as\\nexpected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or\\neven bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California’s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii).\\nIn such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once\\nregarded as among the most stable industries in America.\\nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through\\na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior\\nperformance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely\\nbe required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that\\nutilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE’s\\nextensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some\\nyears from completion. Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the\\ncontinental United States.\\nWith this model employed by both private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on,\\neven if population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The “margin of safety”\\napproach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactory-\\nreturn pact has been broken in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such\\nruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground transmission may be\\nrequired but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay the staggering costs for such construction?\\n13\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3148,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"QIztJp2JWOSVqvFdgSHAXaZxRK9egH28JXSXy+AYvxU=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"242b6d39-601d-4372-a6cf-1551fc619725":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"242b6d39-601d-4372-a6cf-1551fc619725\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"tyrkgHHy+TnWgA1H+G+4o3hXuLLHdVFRATTXd2FoBbc=\"}},\"text\":\"At Berkshire, we have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred.\\nThese costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have increased – and will likely\\ncontinue to increase – if convective storms become more frequent.\\nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s forest-fire losses and can\\nintelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western\\nstates. It remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere.\\nOther electric utilities may face survival problems resembling those of Pacific Gas and\\nElectric and Hawaiian Electric. A confiscatory resolution of our present problems would obviously\\nbe a negative for BHE, but both that company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive\\nnegative surprises. We regularly get these in our insurance business, where our basic product is\\nrisk assumption, and they will occur elsewhere. Berkshire can sustain financial surprises but we\\nwill not knowingly throw good money after bad.\\nWhatever the case at Berkshire, the final result for the utility industry may be ominous:\\nCertain utilities might no longer attract the savings of American citizens and will be forced to\\nadopt the public-power model. Nebraska made this choice in the 1930s and there are many\\npublic-power operations throughout the country. Eventually, voters, taxpayers and users will\\ndecide which model they prefer.\\nWhen the dust settles, America’s power needs and the consequent capital expenditure will\\nbe staggering. I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns\\nand, along with Berkshire’s two partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nEnough about problems: Our insurance business performed exceptionally well last year,\\nsetting records in sales, float and underwriting profits. Property-casualty insurance (“P/C”)\\nprovides the core of Berkshire’s well-being and growth. We have been in the business for 57 years\\nand despite our nearly 5,000-fold increase in volume – from $17 million to $83 billion – we have\\nmuch room to grow.\\nBeyond that, we have learned – too often, painfully – a good deal about what types of\\ninsurance business and what sort of people to avoid. The most important lesson is that our\\nunderwriters can be thin, fat, male, female, young, old, foreign or domestic. But they can’t be\\noptimists at the office, however desirable that quality may generally be in life.\\nSurprises in the P/C business – which can occur decades after six-month or one-year\\npolicies have expired – are almost always negative. The industry’s accounting is designed to\\nrecognize this reality, but estimation mistakes can be huge. And when charlatans are involved,\\ndetection is often both slow and costly. Berkshire will always attempt to be accurate in its estimates\\nof future loss payments but inflation – both monetary and the “legal” variety – is a wild card.\\n14\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2972,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"XSw1V9lbxoSh1uDtTqwgYDFjlJZRFIs+9RslnzxUzP0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"62433869-590e-4436-8b19-82dab562dad2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"62433869-590e-4436-8b19-82dab562dad2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_14\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"w5LXxB7MxytCTRubIXSXHKfPfS1lMwdkdTaby4aQWSQ=\"}},\"text\":\"I’ve told the story of our insurance operations so many times that I will simply direct\\nnewcomers to page 18.

Both Ajit and his\\nwife, Tinku, have many Omaha friends, though it’s been more than three decades since they moved\\nto New York (in order to be where much of the action in reinsurance takes place).\\nMissing from the stage this year will be Charlie.

Its introduction to Europe began in 1782 when a French\\nJesuit Father living in China, Joseph Amiot, acquired a copy of it, and translated it into\\nFrench. It was not a good translation because, according to Dr. Giles, \\\"[I]t contains a\\ngreat deal that Sun Tzu did not write, and very little indeed of what he did.\\\"\\nThe first translation into English was published in 1905 in Tokyo by Capt. E. F.\\nCalthrop, R.F.A. However, this translation is, in the words of Dr. Giles, \\\"excessively\\nbad.\\\" He goes further in this criticism: \\\"It is not merely a question of downright blun-\\nders, from which none can hope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent; hard\\npassages were willfully distorted or slurred over. Such offenses are less pardonable.\\nThey would not be tolerated in any edition of a Latin or Greek classic, and a similar\\nstandard of honesty ought to be insisted upon in translations from Chinese.\\\" In 1908\\na new edition of Capt. Calthrop’s translation was published in London. It was an im-\\nprovement on the first – omissions filled up and numerous mistakes corrected – but\\nnew errors were created in the process. Dr. Giles, in justifying his translation, wrote:\\n\\\"It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate of my own powers; but I could not\\nhelp feeling that Sun Tzu deserved a better fate than had befallen him, and I knew that,\\nat any rate, I could hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors.\\\"\\nClearly, Dr. Giles’ work established much of the groundwork for the work of later\\ntranslators who published their own editions. Of the later editions of the ART OF WAR\\nI have examined; two feature Giles’ edited translation and notes, the other two present\\nthe same basic information from the ancient Chinese commentators found in the Giles\\nedition. Of these four, Giles’ 1910 edition is the most scholarly and presents the reader\\nan incredible amount of information concerning Sun Tzu’s text, much more than any\\nother translation.\\nThe Giles’ edition of the ART OF WAR, as stated above, was a scholarly work.\\nDr. Giles was a leading sinologue at the time and an assistant in the Department of\\nOriental Printed Books and Manuscripts in the British Museum. Apparently he wanted\\nto produce a definitive edition, superior to anything else that existed and perhaps some-\\nthing that would become a standard translation. It was the best translation available for\\n50 years. But apparently there was not much interest in Sun Tzu in English- speaking\\ncountries since it took the start of the Second World War to renew interest in his work.\\nSeveral people published unsatisfactory English translations of Sun Tzu. In 1944, Dr.\\nGiles’ translation was edited and published in the United States in a series of military\\nscience books. But it wasn’t until 1963 that a good English translation (by Samuel B.\\nGriffith and still in print) was published that was an equal to Giles’ translation. While\\nthis translation is more lucid than Dr. Giles’ translation, it lacks his copious notes that\\nmake his so interesting.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"sHQBEpMa4+9DAHFXheFYUn3eDXBnqXPhSQifTXr33Lg=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"CONTENTS 4\\nDr. Giles produced a work primarily intended for scholars of the Chinese civiliza-\\ntion and language. It contains the Chinese text of Sun Tzu, the English translation, and\\nvoluminous notes along with numerous footnotes. Unfortunately, some of his notes and\\nfootnotes contain Chinese characters; some are completely Chinese. Thus, a conver-\\nsion to a Latin alphabet etext was difficult. I did the conversion in complete ignorance\\nof Chinese (except for what I learned while doing the conversion). Thus, I faced the\\ndifficult task of paraphrasing it while retaining as much of the important text as I could.\\nEvery paraphrase represents a loss; thus I did what I could to retain as much of the text\\nas possible. Because the 1910 text contains a Chinese concordance, I was able to trans-\\nliterate proper names, books, and the like at the risk of making the text more obscure.\\nHowever, the text, on the whole, is quite satisfactory for the casual reader, a transform-\\nation made possible by conversion to an etext. However, I come away from this task\\nwith the feeling of loss because I know that someone with a background in Chinese\\ncan do a better job than I did; any such attempt would be welcomed.\\nBob Sutton\\nal876@cleveland.freenet.edu\\nbobs@gnu.ai.mit.edu\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"MDGcnzTt+ny+QM5QsOeXgGc326VVP1+/buQOlYpF9CI=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_6\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":6,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Chapter 1\\nINTRODUCTION\\n1.1 Sun Wu and his Book\\nSsu-ma Ch‘ien gives the following biography of Sun Tzu:1\\nSun Tzu Wu was a native of the Ch‘i State.

Sun Tzu: \\\"If\\nwords of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly\\nunderstood, the general is to blame. But if his orders ARE clear, and the\\nsoldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers.\\\"\\nSo saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be beheaded.\\nNow the king of Wu was watching the scene from the top of a raised\\npavilion; and when he saw that his favorite concubines were about to be\\nexecuted, he was greatly alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following\\nmessage: \\\"We are now quite satisfied as to our general’s ability to handle\\ntroops. If We are bereft of these two concubines, our meat and drink will\\nlose their savor. It is our wish that they shall not be beheaded.\\\"\\nSun Tzu replied: \\\"Having once received His Majesty’s commission to\\nbe the general of his forces, there are certain commands of His Majesty\\nwhich, acting in that capacity, I am unable to accept.\\\"\\nAccordingly, he had the two leaders beheaded, and straightway installed\\nthe pair next in order as leaders in their place. When this had been done,\\nthe drum was sounded for the drill once more; and the girls went through\\nall the evolutions, turning to the right or to the left, marching ahead or\\nwheeling back, kneeling or standing, with perfect accuracy and precision,\\nnot venturing to utter a sound. Then Sun Tzu sent a messenger to the King\\nsaying: \\\"Your soldiers, Sire, are now properly drilled and disciplined, and\\nready for your majesty’s inspection. They can be put to any use that their\\nsovereign may desire; bid them go through fire and water, and they will\\nnot disobey.\\\"\\nBut the King replied: \\\"Let our general cease drilling and return to camp.\\nAs for us, We have no wish to come down and inspect the troops.\\\"\\nThereupon Sun Tzu said: \\\"The King is only fond of words, and cannot\\ntranslate them into deeds.\\\"\\nAfter that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tzu was one who knew how to handle an\\narmy, and finally appointed him general. In the west, he defeated the Ch‘u\\nState and forced his way into Ying, the capital; to the north he put fear\\ninto the States of Ch‘i and Chin, and spread his fame abroad amongst the\\nfeudal princes. And Sun Tzu shared in the might of the King.\\nAbout Sun Tzu himself this is all that Ssu-ma Ch‘ien has to tell us in this chapter. But\\nhe proceeds to give a biography of his descendant, Sun Pin, born about a hundred years\\nafter his famous ancestor’s death, and also the outstanding military genius of his time.\\nThe historian speaks of him too as Sun Tzu, and in his preface we read: \\\"Sun Tzu\\nhad his feet cut off and yet continued to discuss the art of war.\\\"3 It seems likely, then,\\nthat \\\"Pin\\\" was a nickname bestowed on him after his mutilation, unless the story was\\ninvented in order to account for the name.

INTRODUCTION 7\\ncrushing defeat of his treacherous rival P‘ang Chuan, will be found briefly related in\\nChapter V. ss. 19, note.\\nTo return to the elder Sun Tzu. He is mentioned in two other passages of the SHIH\\nCHI:\\nIn the third year of his reign [512 B.C.] Ho Lu, king of Wu, took the\\nfield with Tzu-hsu [i.e. Wu Yuan] and Po P‘ei, and attacked Ch‘u. He\\ncaptured the town of Shu and slew the two prince’s sons who had formerly\\nbeen generals of Wu. He was then meditating a descent on Ying [the\\ncapital]; but the general Sun Wu said: \\\"The army is exhausted. It is not\\nyet possible. We must wait\\\".... [After further successful fighting,] \\\"in the\\nninth year [506 B.C.], King Ho Lu addressed Wu Tzu-hsu and Sun Wu,\\nsaying: \\\"Formerly, you declared that it was not yet possible for us to enter\\nYing. Is the time ripe now?\\\" The two men replied: \\\"Ch‘u’s general Tzu-\\nch‘ang, 4 is grasping and covetous, and the princes of T‘ang and Ts‘ai both\\nhave a grudge against him. If Your Majesty has resolved to make a grand\\nattack, you must win over T‘ang and Ts‘ai, and then you may succeed.\\\"\\nHo Lu followed this advice, [beat Ch‘u in five pitched battles and marched\\ninto Ying.]5\\nThis is the latest date at which anything is recorded of Sun Wu. He does not appear to\\nhave survived his patron, who died from the effects of a wound in 496.\\nIn another chapter there occurs this passage:6\\nFrom this time onward, a number of famous soldiers arose, one after the\\nother: Kao-fan,7 who was employed by the Chin State; Wang-tzu,8 in the\\nservice of Ch‘i; and Sun Wu, in the service of Wu. These men developed\\nand threw light upon the principles of war.\\nIt is obvious enough that Ssu-ma Ch‘ien at least had no doubt about the reality of Sun\\nWu as an historical personage; and with one exception, to be noticed presently, he is\\nby far the most important authority on the period in question. It will not be necessary,\\ntherefore, to say much of such a work as the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU, which is\\nsupposed to have been written by Chao Yeh of the 1st century A.D. The attribution is\\nsomewhat doubtful; but even if it were otherwise, his account would be of little value,\\nbased as it is on the SHIH CHI and expanded with romantic details. The story of Sun\\nTzu will be found, for what it is worth, in chapter 2. The only new points in it worth\\nnoting are: (1) Sun Tzu was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu Tzu-hsu. (2) He is\\ncalled a native of Wu. (3) He had previously lived a retired life, and his contemporaries\\nwere unaware of his ability.\\nThe following passage occurs in the Huai-nan Tzu: \\\"When sovereign and ministers\\nshow perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tzu to encounter the foe.\\\"\\n4The appellation of Nang Wa.\\n5SHI CHI, ch. 31.\\n6SHI CHI, ch. 25.\\n7The appellation of Hu Yen, mentioned in ch. 39 under the year 637.\\n8Wang-tzu Ch‘eng-fu, ch. 32, year 607.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"k9seORHRUTCG9JwMuaCS8OKLw5PBqiPHeZDWMEoY7Pg=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_9":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 8\\nAssuming that this work is genuine (and hitherto no doubt has been cast upon it), we\\nhave here the earliest direct reference for Sun Tzu, for Huai-nan Tzu died in 122 B.C.,\\nmany years before the SHIH CHI was given to the world.\\nLiu Hsiang (80-9 B.C.) says: \\\"The reason why Sun Tzu at the head of 30,000 men\\nbeat Ch‘u with 200,000 is that the latter were undisciplined.\\\"\\nTeng Ming-shih informs us that the surname \\\"Sun\\\" was bestowed on Sun Wu’s\\ngrandfather by Duke Ching of Ch‘i [547-490 B.C.]. Sun Wu’s father Sun P‘ing, rose\\nto be a Minister of State in Ch‘i, and Sun Wu himself, whose style was Ch‘ang-ch‘ing,\\nfled to Wu on account of the rebellion which was being fomented by the kindred of\\nT‘ien Pao. He had three sons, of whom the second, named Ming, was the father of Sun\\nPin. According to this account then, Pin was the grandson of Wu, which, considering\\nthat Sun Pin’s victory over Wei was gained in 341 B.C., may be dismissed as chronolo-\\ngical impossible. Whence these data were obtained by Teng Ming-shih I do not know,\\nbut of course no reliance whatever can be placed in them.\\nAn interesting document which has survived from the close of the Han period is\\nthe short preface written by the Great Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, or Wei Wu Ti, for his edition of Sun\\nTzu. I shall give it in full:\\nI have heard that the ancients used bows and arrows to their advantage.9\\nThe SHU CHU mentions \\\"the army\\\" among the \\\"eight objects of gov-\\nernment.\\\" The I CHING says: \\\"’army’ indicates firmness and justice; the\\nexperienced leader will have good fortune.\\\" The SHIH CHING says: \\\"The\\nKing rose majestic in his wrath, and he marshaled his troops.\\\" The Yellow\\nEmperor, T‘ang the Completer and Wu Wang all used spears and battle-\\naxes in order to succor their generation. The SSU-MA FA says: \\\"If one\\nman slay another of set purpose, he himself may rightfully be slain.\\\" He\\nwho relies solely on warlike measures shall be exterminated; he who relies\\nsolely on peaceful measures shall perish. Instances of this are Fu Ch‘ai10\\non the one hand and Yen Wang on the other. 11 In military matters, the\\nSage’s rule is normally to keep the peace, and to move his forces only\\nwhen occasion requires. He will not use armed force unless driven to it by\\nnecessity.\\nMany books have I read on the subject of war and fighting; but the work\\ncomposed by Sun Wu is the profoundest of them all.

He was a descendant of Wu.] 12 In his treatment of\\ndeliberation and planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the field, 13\\nclearness of conception, and depth of design, Sun Tzu stands beyond the\\nreach of carping criticism. My contemporaries, however, have failed to\\ngrasp the full meaning of his instructions, and while putting into practice\\nthe smaller details in which his work abounds, they have overlooked its\\nessential purport. That is the motive which has led me to outline a rough\\nexplanation of the whole.\\nOne thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit statement that the 13 chapters were\\nspecially composed for King Ho Lu. This is supported by the internal evidence of I. ss.\\n15, in which it seems clear that some ruler is addressed.\\nIn the bibliographic section of the HAN SHU, there is an entry which has given\\nrise to much discussion: \\\"The works of Sun Tzu of Wu in 82 P‘IEN (or chapters), with\\ndiagrams in 9 CHUAN.\\\" It is evident that this cannot be merely the 13 chapters known\\nto Ssu-ma Ch‘ien, or those we possess today. Chang Shou-chieh refers to an edition\\nof Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR of which the \\\"13 chapters\\\" formed the first CHUAN,\\nadding that there were two other CHUAN besides. This has brought forth a theory, that\\nthe bulk of these 82 chapters consisted of other writings of Sun Tzu – we should call\\nthem apocryphal – similar to the WEN TA, of which a specimen dealing with the Nine\\nSituations14 is preserved in the T‘UNG TIEN, and another in Ho Shin’s commentary.\\nIt is suggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzu had only written the\\n13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of question and\\nanswer between himself and the King. Pi I-hsun, the author of the SUN TZU HSU\\nLU, backs this up with a quotation from the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU: \\\"The King of\\nWu summoned Sun Tzu, and asked him questions about the art of war. Each time he\\nset forth a chapter of his work, the King could not find words enough to praise him.\\\"\\nAs he points out, if the whole work was expounded on the same scale as in the above-\\nmentioned fragments, the total number of chapters could not fail to be considerable.\\nThen the numerous other treatises attributed to Sun Tzu might be included. The fact\\nthat the HAN CHIH mentions no work of Sun Tzu except the 82 P‘IEN, whereas the\\nSui and T‘ang bibliographies give the titles of others in addition to the \\\"13 chapters,\\\" is\\ngood proof, Pi I-hsun thinks, that all of these were contained in the 82 P‘IEN. Without\\npinning our faith to the accuracy of details supplied by the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU,\\nor admitting the genuineness of any of the treatises cited by Pi I-hsun, we may see in\\nthis theory a probable solution of the mystery. Between Ssu-ma Ch‘ien and Pan Ku\\nthere was plenty of time for a luxuriant crop of forgeries to have grown up under the\\nmagic name of Sun Tzu, and the 82 P‘IEN may very well represent a collected edition\\nof these lumped together with the original work. It is also possible, though less likely,\\nthat some of them existed in the time of the earlier historian and were purposely ignored\\nby him.15\\n12The passage I have put in brackets is omitted in the T‘U SHU, and may be an interpolation. It was\\nknown, however to Chang Shou-chieh of the T‘ang dynasty, and appears in the T‘AI P‘ING YU LAN.\\n13Ts‘ao Kung seems to be thinking of the first part of chap.

This, as Sun Hsing-yen points\\nout, is only a modest way of saying that he made an explanatory paraphrase, or in other\\nwords, wrote a commentary on it. On the whole, this theory has met with very little\\nacceptance. Thus, the SSU K‘U CH‘UAN SHU says: \\\"The mention of the 13 chapters\\nin the SHIH CHI shows that they were in existence before the HAN CHIH, and that\\nlatter accretions are not to be considered part of the original work. Tu Mu’s assertion\\ncan certainly not be taken as proof.\\\"\\nThere is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters existed in the time of\\nSsu-ma Ch‘ien practically as we have them now. That the work was then well known\\nhe tells us in so many words. \\\"Sun Tzu’s 13 Chapters and Wu Ch‘i’s Art of War are the\\ntwo books that people commonly refer to on the subject of military matters. Both of\\nthem are widely distributed, so I will not discuss them here.\\\" But as we go further back,\\nserious difficulties begin to arise. The salient fact which has to be faced is that the TSO\\nCHUAN, the greatest contemporary record, makes no mention whatsoever of Sun Wu,\\neither as a general or as a writer. It is natural, in view of this awkward circumstance,\\nthat many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story of Sun Wu as given in the\\nSHIH CHI, but even show themselves frankly skeptical as to the existence of the man\\nat all. The most powerful presentment of this side of the case is to be found in the\\nfollowing disposition by Yeh Shui-hsin:16\\nIt is stated in Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s history that Sun Wu was a native of the Ch‘i\\nState, and employed by Wu; and that in the reign of Ho Lu he crushed\\nCh‘u, entered Ying, and was a great general. But in Tso’s Commentary no\\nSun Wu appears at all. It is true that Tso’s Commentary need not contain\\nabsolutely everything that other histories contain. But Tso has not omitted\\nto mention vulgar plebeians and hireling ruffians such as Ying K‘ao-shu,17\\nTs‘ao Kuei,18, Chu Chih-wu and Chuan She-chu19. In the case of Sun\\nWu, whose fame and achievements were so brilliant, the omission is much\\nmore glaring. Again, details are given, in their due order, about his con-\\ntemporaries Wu Yuan and the Minister P‘ei.20 Is it credible that Sun Wu\\nalone should have been passed over?\\nIn point of literary style, Sun Tzu’s work belongs to the same school as\\nKUAN TZU,21 LIU T‘AO,22 and the YUEH YU23 and may have been the\\nproduction of some private scholar living towards the end of the \\\"Spring\\nthe case of very short works, one is tempted to think that P‘IEN might simply mean \\\"leaves.\\\"\\n16Yeh Shih of the Sung dynasty [1151-1223].\\n17He hardly deserves to be bracketed with assassins.\\n18See Chapter 7, ss. 27 and Chapter 11, ss. 28.\\n19See Chapter 11, ss. 28.

The story of Ho Lu’s experiment on the\\nwomen, in particular, is utterly preposterous and incredible.\\nYeh Shui-hsin represents Ssu-ma Ch‘ien as having said that Sun Wu crushed Ch‘u and\\nentered Ying.

Moreover, as\\nwe know that Wu Yuan and Po P‘ei both took part in the expedition, and also that its\\nsuccess was largely due to the dash and enterprise of Fu Kai, Ho Lu’s younger brother,\\nit is not easy to see how yet another general could have played a very prominent part\\nin the same campaign.\\nCh‘en Chen-sun of the Sung dynasty has the note:\\nMilitary writers look upon Sun Wu as the father of their art.

The former lived only a century after the\\nalleged date of Sun Tzu, and his death is known to have taken place in 381 B.C. It was\\nto him, according to Liu Hsiang, that Tseng Shen delivered the TSO CHUAN, which\\nhad been entrusted to him by its author.28 Now the fact that quotations from the ART\\nOF WAR, acknowledged or otherwise, are to be found in so many authors of differ-\\nent epochs, establishes a very strong anterior to them all, – in other words, that Sun\\nTzu’s treatise was already in existence towards the end of the 5th century B.C. Further\\nproof of Sun Tzu’s antiquity is furnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings\\nattaching to a number of the words he uses. A list of these, which might perhaps be\\nextended, is given in the HSU LU; and though some of the interpretations are doubtful,\\nthe main argument is hardly affected thereby. Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh\\nShui- hsin, a scholar and critic of the first rank, deliberately pronounces the style of the\\n13 chapters to belong to the early part of the fifth century. Seeing that he is actually\\nengaged in an attempt to disprove the existence of Sun Wu himself, we may be sure that\\nhe would not have hesitated to assign the work to a later date had he not honestly be-\\nlieved the contrary. And it is precisely on such a point that the judgment of an educated\\nChinaman will carry most weight. Other internal evidence is not far to seek. Thus in\\nXIII. ss. 1, there is an unmistakable allusion to the ancient system of land-tenure which\\nhad already passed away by the time of Mencius, who was anxious to see it revived in\\na modified form.29 The only warfare Sun Tzu knows is that carried on between the\\nvarious feudal princes, in which armored chariots play a large part. Their use seems to\\nhave entirely died out before the end of the Chou dynasty. He speaks as a man of Wu,\\na state which ceased to exist as early as 473 B.C. On this I shall touch presently.\\nBut once refer the work to the 5th century or earlier, and the chances of its being\\nother than a bona fide production are sensibly diminished. The great age of forgeries\\ndid not come until long after. That it should have been forged in the period immedi-\\nately following 473 is particularly unlikely, for no one, as a rule, hastens to identify\\nhimself with a lost cause. As for Yeh Shui-hsin’s theory, that the author was a literary\\nrecluse, that seems to me quite untenable. If one thing is more apparent than another\\nafter reading the maxims of Sun Tzu, it is that their essence has been distilled from\\na large store of personal observation and experience. They reflect the mind not only\\nof a born strategist, gifted with a rare faculty of generalization, but also of a practical\\nsoldier closely acquainted with the military conditions of his time. To say nothing of\\nthe fact that these sayings have been accepted and endorsed by all the greatest captains\\nof Chinese history, they offer a combination of freshness and sincerity, acuteness and\\ncommon sense, which quite excludes the idea that they were artificially concocted in\\nthe study. If we admit, then, that the 13 chapters were the genuine production of a\\nmilitary man living towards the end of the \\\"CH‘UN CH‘IU\\\" period, are we not bound,\\nin spite of the silence of the TSO CHUAN, to accept Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s account in its\\nentirety?

INTRODUCTION 13\\nthat the records he drew upon for Sun Wu’s biography were false and untrustworthy?\\nThe answer, I fear, must be in the negative. There is still one grave, if not fatal, objec-\\ntion to the chronology involved in the story as told in the SHIH CHI, which, so far as I\\nam aware, nobody has yet pointed out. There are two passages in Sun Tzu in which he\\nalludes to contemporary affairs. The first in in VI. ss. 21:\\nThough according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in\\nnumber, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say\\nthen that victory can be achieved.\\nThe other is in XI. ss. 30:\\nAsked if an army can be made to imitate the SHUAI-JAN, I should answer,\\nYes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are\\ncrossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come\\nto each other’s assistance just as the left hand helps the right.\\nThese two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of composition.\\nThey assign the work to the period of the struggle between Wu and Yueh. So much\\nhas been observed by Pi I-hsun. But what has hitherto escaped notice is that they also\\nseriously impair the credibility of Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s narrative. As we have seen above,\\nthe first positive date given in connection with Sun Wu is 512 B.C. He is then spoken\\nof as a general, acting as confidential adviser to Ho Lu, so that his alleged introduction\\nto that monarch had already taken place, and of course the 13 chapters must have been\\nwritten earlier still. But at that time, and for several years after, down to the capture\\nof Ying in 506, Ch‘u and not Yueh, was the great hereditary enemy of Wu. The two\\nstates, Ch‘u and Wu, had been constantly at war for over half a century, 30 whereas the\\nfirst war between Wu and Yueh was waged only in 510, 31 and even then was no more\\nthan a short interlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with Ch‘u. Now\\nCh‘u is not mentioned in the 13 chapters at all. The natural inference is that they were\\nwritten at a time when Yueh had become the prime antagonist of Wu, that is, after Ch‘u\\nhad suffered the great humiliation of 506. At this point, a table of dates may be found\\nuseful.\\n30When Wu first appears in the CH‘UN CH‘IU in 584, it is already at variance with its powerful neighbor.\\nThe CH‘UN CH‘IU first mentions Yueh in 537, the TSO CHUAN in 601.\\n31This is explicitly stated in the TSO CHUAN, XXXII, 2.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"pOzS38zssURVZ7sVyY4Ehu0rzMDvIGYr+v/Q27fMQQY=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_15":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_15\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

It seems rather to imply that, for the moment at\\nleast, the tide had turned against Wu, and that she was getting the worst of the struggle.\\nHence we may conclude that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which\\ndate Yueh does not appear to have scored any notable success against Wu. Ho Lu died\\nin 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must have been during the period\\n505-496, when there was a lull in the hostilities, Wu having presumably exhausted\\nby its supreme effort against Ch‘u. On the other hand, if we choose to disregard the\\ntradition connecting Sun Wu’s name with Ho Lu, it might equally well have seen the\\nlight between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period 482-473, when Yueh was once\\nagain becoming a very serious menace.32 We may feel fairly certain that the author,\\nwhoever he may have been, was not a man of any great eminence in his own day.\\nOn this point the negative testimony of the TSO CHUAN far outweighs any shred of\\nauthority still attaching to the SHIH CHI, if once its other facts are discredited. Sun\\nHsing-yen, however, makes a feeble attempt to explain the omission of his name from\\nthe great commentary. It was Wu Tzu-hsu, he says, who got all the credit of Sun Wu’s\\nexploits, because the latter (being an alien) was not rewarded with an office in the State.\\nHow then did the Sun Tzu legend originate? It may be that the growing celebrity\\nof the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown to its author. It was felt\\nto be only right and proper that one so well versed in the science of war should have\\nsolid achievements to his credit as well. Now the capture of Ying was undoubtedly the\\ngreatest feat of arms in Ho Lu’s reign; it made a deep and lasting impression on all the\\nsurrounding states, and raised Wu to the short-lived zenith of her power. Hence, what\\nmore natural, as time went on, than that the acknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu,\\nshould be popularly identified with that campaign, at first perhaps only in the sense that\\nhis brain conceived and planned it; afterwards, that it was actually carried out by him\\n32There is this to be said for the later period, that the feud would tend to grow more bitter after each\\nencounter, and thus more fully justify the language used in XI. ss. 30.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"LJO1aepJh5AfE1vq3ZXXLQEXdax5tfI4UAE1aJfVb1U=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_16":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_16\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":16,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 15\\nin conjunction with Wu Yuan,33 Po P‘ei and Fu Kai?\\nIt is obvious that any attempt to reconstruct even the outline of Sun Tzu’s life must\\nbe based almost wholly on conjecture. With this necessary proviso, I should say that he\\nprobably entered the service of Wu about the time of Ho Lu’s accession, and gathered\\nexperience, though only in the capacity of a subordinate officer, during the intense mil-\\nitary activity which marked the first half of the prince’s reign.34 If he rose to be a gen-\\neral at all, he certainly was never on an equal footing with the three above mentioned.\\nHe was doubtless present at the investment and occupation of Ying, and witnessed Wu’s\\nsudden collapse in the following year. Yueh’s attack at this critical juncture, when her\\nrival was embarrassed on every side, seems to have convinced him that this upstart\\nkingdom was the great enemy against whom every effort would henceforth have to be\\ndirected. Sun Wu was thus a well-seasoned warrior when he sat down to write his\\nfamous book, which according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the end,\\nrather than the beginning of Ho Lu’s reign. The story of the women may possibly have\\ngrown out of some real incident occurring about the same time. As we hear no more\\nof Sun Wu after this from any source, he is hardly likely to have survived his patron\\nor to have taken part in the death-struggle with Yueh, which began with the disaster at\\nTsuili.\\nIf these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain irony in the fate\\nwhich decreed that China’s most illustrious man of peace should be contemporary with\\nher greatest writer on war.\\n1.2 The Text of Sun Tzu\\nI have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzu’s text. The quo-\\ntations that occur in early authors go to show that the \\\"13 chapters\\\" of which Ssu-ma\\nCh‘ien speaks were essentially the same as those now extant. We have his word for it\\nthat they were widely circulated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from\\ndiscussing them on that account. Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface:\\nDuring the Ch‘in and Han dynasties Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR was in\\ngeneral use amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated\\nit as a work of mysterious import, and were unwilling to expound it for the\\nbenefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was the first to write\\na commentary on it.\\nAs we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that Ts‘ao Kung\\ntampered with the text.

Towards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the chief com-\\nmentaries on Sun Tzu were in existence, a certain Chi T‘ien-pao published a work in\\n15 CHUAN entitled \\\"Sun Tzu with the collected commentaries of ten writers.\\\" There\\nwas another text, with variant readings put forward by Chu Fu of Ta-hsing, which also\\nhad supporters among the scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun Hsing-\\nyen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no longer put into circula-\\ntion. Thus, until the end of the 18th century, the text in sole possession of the field\\nwas one derived from Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition, although no actual copy of that import-\\nant work was known to have survived. That, therefore, is the text of Sun Tzu which\\nappears in the War section of the great Imperial encyclopedia printed in 1726, the KU\\nCHIN T‘U SHU CHI CH‘ENG. Another copy at my disposal of what is practically\\nthe same text, with slight variations, is that contained in the \\\"Eleven philosophers of\\nthe Chou and Ch‘in dynasties\\\" [1758]. And the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop’s\\nfirst edition is evidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese channels.\\nSo things remained until Sun Hsing-yen [1752-1818], a distinguished antiquarian and\\nclassical scholar, who claimed to be an actual descendant of Sun Wu,35 accidentally\\ndiscovered a copy of Chi T‘ien-pao’s long-lost work, when on a visit to the library\\nof the Hua-yin temple.36 Appended to it was the I SHUO of Cheng Yu-Hsien, men-\\ntioned in the T‘UNG CHIH, and also believed to have perished. This is what Sun\\nHsing-yen designates as the \\\"original edition (or text)\\\" – a rather misleading name, for\\nit cannot by any means claim to set before us the text of Sun Tzu in its pristine purity.\\nChi T‘ien-pao was a careless compiler, and appears to have been content to reproduce\\nthe somewhat debased version current in his day, without troubling to collate it with\\nthe earliest editions then available. Fortunately, two versions of Sun Tzu, even older\\nthan the newly discovered work, were still extant, one buried in the T‘UNG TIEN, Tu\\nYu’s great treatise on the Constitution, the other similarly enshrined in the T‘AI P‘ING\\nYU LAN encyclopedia. In both the complete text is to be found, though split up into\\nfragments, intermixed with other matter, and scattered piecemeal over a number of dif-\\nferent sections. Considering that the YU LAN takes us back to the year 983, and the\\nT‘UNG TIEN about 200 years further still, to the middle of the T‘ang dynasty, the\\nvalue of these early transcripts of Sun Tzu can hardly be overestimated. Yet the idea of\\nutilizing them does not seem to have occurred to anyone until Sun Hsing-yen, acting\\nunder Government instructions, undertook a thorough recension of the text. This is his\\nown account:\\nBecause of the numerous mistakes in the text of Sun Tzu which his editors\\nhad handed down, the Government ordered that the ancient edition [of\\nChi T‘ien-pao] should be used, and that the text should be revised and\\ncorrected throughout. It happened that Wu Nien-hu, the Governor Pi Kua,\\nand Hsi, a graduate of the second degree, had all devoted themselves to\\n35Preface ad fin: \\\"My family comes from Lo-an, and we are really descended from Sun Tzu.

Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition places him after Chia\\nLin,and Ch‘ao Kung- wu also assigns him to the T‘ang dynasty,40 but this is a\\nmistake. In Sun Hsing-yen’s preface, he appears as Meng Shih of the Liang dyn-\\nasty [502-557]. Others would identify him with Meng K‘ang of the 3rd century.\\nHe is named in one work as the last of the \\\"Five Commentators,\\\" the others being\\nWei Wu Ti, Tu Mu, Ch‘en Hao and Chia Lin.\\n3. LI CH‘UAN of the 8th century was a well-known writer on military tactics. One\\nof his works has been in constant use down to the present day. The T‘UNG CHIH\\nmentions \\\"Lives of famous generals from the Chou to the T‘ang dynasty\\\" as\\nwritten by him.41 According to Ch‘ao Kung-wu and the T‘IEN-I-KO catalogue,\\nhe followed a variant of the text of Sun Tzu which differs considerably from\\nthose now extant. His notes are mostly short and to the point, and he frequently\\nillustrates his remarks by anecdotes from Chinese history.\\n4. TU YU (died 812) did not publish a separate commentary on Sun Tzu, his notes\\nbeing taken from the T‘UNG TIEN, the encyclopedic treatise on the Constitution\\nwhich was his life- work. They are largely repetitions of Ts‘ao Kung and Meng\\nShih, besides which it is believed that he drew on the ancient commentaries of\\nWang Ling and others.

In attempting to provide a critical commentary\\nfor Sun Tzu’s work, he does not lose sight of the fact that these sayings were in-\\ntended for states engaged in internecine warfare; that the author is not concerned\\nwith the military conditions prevailing under the sovereigns of the three ancient\\ndynasties,42 nor with the nine punitive measures prescribed to the Minister of\\nWar.43 Again, Sun Wu loved brevity of diction, but his meaning is always deep.\\nWhether the subject be marching an army, or handling soldiers, or estimating the\\nenemy, or controlling the forces of victory, it is always systematically treated; the\\nsayings are bound together in strict logical sequence, though this has been ob-\\nscured by commentators who have probably failed to grasp their meaning.

The personal name of this commentator is\\ngiven as above by Cheng Ch‘iao in the TUNG CHIH, written about the middle\\nof the twelfth century, but he appears simply as Ho Shih in the YU HAI, and Ma\\nTuan-lin quotes Ch‘ao Kung-wu as saying that his personal name is unknown.\\nThere seems to be no reason to doubt Cheng Ch‘iao’s statement, otherwise I\\nshould have been inclined to hazard a guess and identify him with one Ho Ch‘u-\\nfei, the author of a short treatise on war, who lived in the latter part of the 11th\\ncentury.

CHANG YU. The list closes with a commentator of no great originality perhaps,\\nbut gifted with admirable powers of lucid exposition. His commentator is based\\non that of Ts‘ao Kung, whose terse sentences he contrives to expand and develop\\nin masterly fashion. Without Chang Yu, it is safe to say that much of Ts‘ao\\nKung’s commentary would have remained cloaked in its pristine obscurity and\\ntherefore valueless. His work is not mentioned in the Sung history, the T‘UNG\\nK‘AO, or the YU HAI, but it finds a niche in the T‘UNG CHIH, which also\\nnames him as the author of the \\\"Lives of Famous Generals.\\\"45\\nIt is rather remarkable that the last-named four should all have flourished within\\nso short a space of time. Ch‘ao Kung-wu accounts for it by saying: \\\"During\\nthe early years of the Sung dynasty the Empire enjoyed a long spell of peace,\\nand men ceased to practice the art of war. but when [Chao] Yuan-hao’s rebellion\\ncame [1038-42] and the frontier generals were defeated time after time, the Court\\nmade strenuous inquiry for men skilled in war, and military topics became the\\n44T‘UNG K‘AO, ch. 221.\\n45This appears to be still extant.

Among the famous generals who are known to have studied his pages with en-\\nthusiasm may be mentioned Han Hsin (d. 196 B.C.),48 Feng I (d. 34 A.D.),49 Lu Meng\\n(d. 219),50 and Yo Fei (1103-1141).51 The opinion of Ts‘ao Kung, who disputes with\\nHan Hsin the highest place in Chinese military annals, has already been recorded.52\\nStill more remarkable, in one way, is the testimony of purely literary men, such as Su\\nHsun (the father of Su Tung-p‘o), who wrote several essays on military topics, all of\\nwhich owe their chief inspiration to Sun Tzu. The following short passage by him is\\npreserved in the YU HAI:53\\nSun Wu’s saying, that in war one cannot make certain of conquering,54 is\\nvery different indeed from what other books tell us.55 Wu Ch‘i was a man\\nof the same stamp as Sun Wu: they both wrote books on war, and they\\nare linked together in popular speech as \\\"Sun and Wu.\\\" But Wu Ch‘i’s\\nremarks on war are less weighty, his rules are rougher and more crudely\\nstated, and there is not the same unity of plan as in Sun Tzu’s work, where\\nthe style is terse, but the meaning fully brought out.\\nThe following is an extract from the \\\"Impartial Judgments in the Garden of Literature\\\"\\nby Cheng Hou:\\n46T‘UNG K‘AO, loc. cit.\\n47A notable person in his day.

Language of\\nthis sort, he says, \\\"encourages a ruler’s bent towards unrelenting warfare and reckless\\nmilitarism.\\\"\\n1.5 Apologies for War\\nAccustomed as we are to think of China as the greatest peace-loving nation on earth,\\nwe are in some danger of forgetting that her experience of war in all its phases has\\nalso been such as no modern State can parallel. Her long military annals stretch back\\nto a point at which they are lost in the mists of time. She had built the Great Wall\\nand was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries before the first\\nRoman legionary was seen on the Danube. What with the perpetual collisions of the\\nancient feudal States, the grim conflicts with Huns, Turks and other invaders after the\\ncentralization of government, the terrific upheavals which accompanied the overthrow\\nof so many dynasties, besides the countless rebellions and minor disturbances that have\\nflamed up and flickered out again one by one, it is hardly too much to say that the clash\\nof arms has never ceased to resound in one portion or another of the Empire.\\nNo less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom China can\\npoint with pride. As in all countries, the greatest are fond of emerging at the most\\nfateful crises of her history. Thus, Po Ch‘i stands out conspicuous in the period when\\nCh‘in was entering upon her final struggle with the remaining independent states. The\\nstormy years which followed the break-up of the Ch‘in dynasty are illuminated by\\nthe transcendent genius of Han Hsin. When the House of Han in turn is tottering to\\nits fall, the great and baleful figure of Ts‘ao Ts‘ao dominates the scene. And in the\\nestablishment of the T‘ang dynasty,one of the mightiest tasks achieved by man, the\\nsuperhuman energy of Li Shih-min (afterwards the Emperor T‘ai Tsung) was seconded\\nby the brilliant strategy of Li Ching. None of these generals need fear comparison with\\nthe greatest names in the military history of Europe.\\nIn spite of all this, the great body of Chinese sentiment, from Lao Tzu downwards,\\nand especially as reflected in the standard literature of Confucianism, has been consist-\\nently pacific and intensely opposed to militarism in any form.

When he is pleased, a feeling of affection springs up within him;\\nwhen angry, his poisoned sting is brought into play. That is the natural law\\nwhich governs his being....

They will surely\\nbring our country to impotence and dishonor and the loss of her rightful\\nheritage; or, at the very least, they will bring about invasion and rebellion,\\nsacrifice of territory and general enfeeblement. Yet they obstinately refuse\\nto modify the position they have taken up. The truth is that, just as in the\\nfamily the teacher must not spare the rod, and punishments cannot be dis-\\npensed with in the State, so military chastisement can never be allowed to\\nfall into abeyance in the Empire. All one can say is that this power will be\\nexercised wisely by some, foolishly by others, and that among those who\\nbear arms some will be loyal and others rebellious.57\\nThe next piece is taken from Tu Mu’s preface to his commentary on Sun Tzu:\\nWar may be defined as punishment, which is one of the functions of gov-\\nernment. It was the profession of Chung Yu and Jan Ch‘iu, both disciples\\nof Confucius. Nowadays, the holding of trials and hearing of litigation, the\\nimprisonment of offenders and their execution by flogging in the market-\\nplace, are all done by officials. But the wielding of huge armies, the throw-\\ning down of fortified cities, the hauling of women and children into cap-\\ntivity, and the beheading of traitors – this is also work which is done by\\nofficials. The objects of the rack and of military weapons are essentially\\nthe same. There is no intrinsic difference between the punishment of flog-\\nging and cutting off heads in war. For the lesser infractions of law, which\\nare easily dealt with, only a small amount of force need be employed:\\nhence the use of military weapons and wholesale decapitation. In both\\ncases, however, the end in view is to get rid of wicked people, and to give\\ncomfort and relief to the good....\\nChi-sun asked Jan Yu, saying: \\\"Have you, Sir, acquired your military\\naptitude by study, or is it innate?\\\" Jan Yu replied: \\\"It has been acquired\\nby study.\\\"58 \\\"How can that be so,\\\" said Chi-sun, \\\"seeing that you are a\\ndisciple of Confucius?\\\" \\\"It is a fact,\\\" replied Jan Yu; \\\"I was taught by\\nConfucius.

If any are bold enough to discuss the subject, they are\\nat once set down as eccentric individuals of coarse and brutal propensities.\\nThis is an extraordinary instance in which, through sheer lack of reasoning,\\nmen unhappily lose sight of fundamental principles.\\nWhen the Duke of Chou was minister under Ch‘eng Wang, he regulated\\nceremonies and made music, and venerated the arts of scholarship and\\nlearning; yet when the barbarians of the River Huai revolted,59 he sallied\\nforth and chastised them. When Confucius held office under the Duke\\nof Lu, and a meeting was convened at Chia-ku,60 he said: \\\"If pacific ne-\\ngotiations are in progress, warlike preparations should have been made\\nbeforehand.\\\" He rebuked and shamed the Marquis of Ch‘i, who cowered\\nunder him and dared not proceed to violence. How can it be said that these\\ntwo great Sages had no knowledge of military matters?\\nWe have seen that the great Chu Hsi held Sun Tzu in high esteem. He also appeals to\\nthe authority of the Classics:\\nOur Master Confucius, answering Duke Ling of Wei, said: \\\"I have never\\nstudied matters connected with armies and battalions.\\\"61 Replying to K‘ung\\nWen-tzu, he said: I have not been instructed about buff-coats and weapons.\\\"\\nBut if we turn to the meeting at Chia-ku, we find that he used armed force\\nagainst the men of Lai, so that the marquis of Ch‘i was overawed. Again,\\nwhen the inhabitants of Pi revolted, the ordered his officers to attack them,\\nwhereupon they were defeated and fled in confusion. He once uttered the\\nwords: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\"62 And Jan Yu also said: \\\"The Sage exercises\\nboth civil and military functions.\\\"63 Can it be a fact that Confucius never\\nstudied or received instruction in the art of war? We can only say that he\\ndid not specially choose matters connected with armies and fighting to be\\nthe subject of his teaching.\\nSun Hsing-yen, the editor of Sun Tzu, writes in similar strain:\\nConfucius said: \\\"I am unversed in military matters.\\\"64 He also said: \\\"If\\nI fight, I conquer.\\\" Confucius ordered ceremonies and regulated music.\\nNow war constitutes one of the five classes of State ceremonial,65 and\\n59See SHU CHING, preface ss. 55.\\n60See SHIH CHI, ch. 47.\\n61Lun Yu, XV. 1.\\n62I failed to trace this utterance.\\n63Supra.\\n64Supra.\\n65The other four being worship, mourning, entertainment of guests, and festive rites.

Hence, the words\\n\\\"I am unversed in\\\" must be taken to mean that there are things which even\\nan inspired Teacher does not know. Those who have to lead an army and\\ndevise stratagems, must learn the art of war. But if one can command\\nthe services of a good general like Sun Tzu, who was employed by Wu\\nTzu-hsu, there is no need to learn it oneself. Hence the remark added by\\nConfucius: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\"\\nThe men of the present day, however, willfully interpret these words of\\nConfucius in their narrowest sense, as though he meant that books on the\\nart of war were not worth reading. With blind persistency, they adduce the\\nexample of Chao Kua, who pored over his father’s books to no purpose,66\\nas a proof that all military theory is useless. Again, seeing that books on\\nwar have to do with such things as opportunism in designing plans, and\\nthe conversion of spies, they hold that the art is immoral and unworthy of\\na sage. These people ignore the fact that the studies of our scholars and\\nthe civil administration of our officials also require steady application and\\npractice before efficiency is reached. The ancients were particularly chary\\nof allowing mere novices to botch their work.67 Weapons are baneful68\\nand fighting perilous; and useless unless a general is in constant practice,\\nhe ought not to hazard other men’s lives in battle.69 Hence it is essential\\nthat Sun Tzu’s 13 chapters should be studied.\\nHsiang Liang used to instruct his nephew Chi70 in the art of war. Chi got\\na rough idea of the art in its general bearings, but would not pursue his\\nstudies to their proper outcome, the consequence being that he was finally\\ndefeated and overthrown. He did not realize that the tricks and artifices\\nof war are beyond verbal computation. Duke Hsiang of Sung and King\\nYen of Hsu were brought to destruction by their misplaced humanity. The\\ntreacherous and underhand nature of war necessitates the use of guile and\\nstratagem suited to the occasion. There is a case on record of Confucius\\nhimself having violated an extorted oath,71 and also of his having left the\\nSung State in disguise.72 Can we then recklessly arraign Sun Tzu for dis-\\nregarding truth and honesty?\\n66See XIII. ss. 11, note.\\n67This is a rather obscure allusion to the TSO CHUAN, where Tzu-ch‘an says: \\\"If you have a piece of\\nbeautiful brocade, you will not employ a mere learner to make it up.\\\"\\n68Cf.

Ts‘ao Kung, Li Ch‘uan, Meng Shih, Tu Yu, Tu Mu and\\nMei Yao-ch‘en have notes to the effect that a general, though naturally\\nstupid, may nevertheless conquer through sheer force of rapidity. Ho\\nShih says: \\\"Haste may be stupid, but at any rate it saves expenditure of\\nenergy and treasure; protracted operations may be very clever, but they\\nbring calamity in their train.\\\" Wang Hsi evades the difficulty by remark-\\ning: \\\"Lengthy operations mean an army growing old, wealth being expen-\\nded, an empty exchequer and distress among the people; true cleverness\\ninsures against the occurrence of such calamities.\\\" Chang Yu says: \\\"So\\nlong as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable to clever dilat-\\noriness.\\\" Now Sun Tzu says nothing whatever, except possibly by implic-\\nation, about ill-considered haste being better than ingenious but lengthy\\noperations. What he does say is something much more guarded, namely\\nthat, while speed may sometimes be injudicious, tardiness can never be\\nanything but foolish – if only because it means impoverishment to the na-\\ntion. In considering the point raised here by Sun Tzu, the classic example\\nof Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur to the mind. That general de-\\nliberately measured the endurance of Rome against that of Hannibals’s\\nisolated army, because it seemed to him that the latter was more likely to\\nsuffer from a long campaign in a strange country. But it is quite a moot\\nquestion whether his tactics would have proved successful in the long run.\\nTheir reversal it is true, led to Cannae; but this only establishes a negative\\npresumption in their favor.]\\n6. There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.\\n7. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can\\nthoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.\\n[That is, with rapidity. Only one who knows the disastrous effects of a\\nlong war can realize the supreme importance of rapidity in bringing it to\\na close.

Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will\\nwin who knows when to fight and when not to fight.\\n[Chang Yu says: If he can fight, he advances and takes the offensive; if\\nhe cannot fight, he retreats and remains on the defensive. He will invari-\\nably conquer who knows whether it is right to take the offensive or the\\ndefensive.]\\n(2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.\\n[This is not merely the general’s ability to estimate numbers correctly, as\\nLi Ch‘uan and others make out. Chang Yu expounds the saying more sat-\\nisfactorily: \\\"By applying the art of war, it is possible with a lesser force\\nto defeat a greater, and vice versa. The secret lies in an eye for locality,\\nand in not letting the right moment slip.

A comment on the T‘ang Emperor T‘ai Tsung goes to the\\nroot of the matter: ’A CH‘I maneuver may be CHENG, if we make the\\nenemy look upon it as CHENG; then our real attack will be CH‘I, and vice\\nversa. The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot\\nfathom our real intent.’\\\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack\\nor other operation is CHENG, on which the enemy has had his attention\\nfixed; whereas that is CH‘I,\\\" which takes him by surprise or comes from\\nan unexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant\\nto be CH‘I,\\\" it immediately becomes CHENG.\\\"]\\n4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an\\negg - this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.\\n5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect\\nmethods will be needed in order to secure victory.\\n[Chang Yu says: \\\"Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding\\nthe enemy’s flanks or falling on his rear.\\\" A brilliant example of \\\"indirect\\ntactics\\\" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord Roberts’ night\\nmarch round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.1\\n6.

P‘ang Chuan\\npursued them hotly, saying to himself: \\\"I knew these men of Ch‘i were\\ncowards: their numbers have already fallen away by more than half.\\\" In\\nhis retreat, Sun Pin came to a narrow defile, with he calculated that his\\npursuers would reach after dark. Here he had a tree stripped of its bark,\\nand inscribed upon it the words: \\\"Under this tree shall P‘ang Chuan die.\\\"\\nThen, as night began to fall, he placed a strong body of archers in ambush\\nnear by, with orders to shoot directly they saw a light.

Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of\\nthe way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before\\nhim, shows knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION.\\n[Tu Mu cites the famous march of Chao She in 270 B.C. to relieve the\\ntown of O-yu, which was closely invested by a Ch‘in army. The King of\\nChao first consulted Lien P‘o on the advisability of attempting a relief,\\nbut the latter thought the distance too great, and the intervening country\\ntoo rugged and difficult. His Majesty then turned to Chao She, who fully\\nadmitted the hazardous nature of the march, but finally said: \\\"We shall be\\nlike two rats fighting in a whole–and the pluckier one will win!\\\" So he left\\nthe capital with his army, but had only gone a distance of 30 LI when he\\nstopped and began throwing up entrenchments. For 28 days he continued\\nstrengthening his fortifications, and took care that spies should carry the\\nintelligence to the enemy. The Ch‘in general was overjoyed, and attributed\\nhis adversary’s tardiness to the fact that the beleaguered city was in the\\nHan State, and thus not actually part of Chao territory. But the spies had\\nno sooner departed than Chao She began a forced march lasting for two\\ndays and one night, and arrive on the scene of action with such astonishing\\nrapidity that he was able to occupy a commanding position on the \\\"North\\nhill\\\" before the enemy had got wind of his movements. A crushing defeat\\nfollowed for the Ch‘in forces, who were obliged to raise the siege of O-yu\\nin all haste and retreat across the border.]\\n5.

The commentators using the standard text take this line to\\nmean that maneuvers may be profitable, or they may be dangerous: it all\\ndepends on the ability of the general.]\\n6.

Man-\\neuvers of this description should be confined to short distances. Stonewall\\nJackson said: \\\"The hardships of forced marches are often more painful\\nthan the dangers of battle.\\\" He did not often call upon his troops for ex-\\ntraordinary exertions.

For instance, \\\"a certain road may be the shortest\\nway for him, but if he knows that it abounds in natural obstacles, or that\\nthe enemy has laid an ambush on it, he will not follow that road. A hostile\\nforce may be open to attack, but if he knows that it is hard-pressed and\\nlikely to fight with desperation, he will refrain from striking,\\\" and so on.]\\n7.

T‘ai Kung\\nsaid: \\\"He who lets an advantage slip will subsequently bring upon himself\\nreal disaster.\\\" In 404 A.D., Liu Yu pursued the rebel Huan Hsuan up the\\nYangtsze and fought a naval battle with him at the island of Ch‘eng-hung.\\nThe loyal troops numbered only a few thousands, while their opponents\\nwere in great force. But Huan Hsuan, fearing the fate which was in store\\nfor him should be be overcome, had a light boat made fast to the side of\\nhis war-junk, so that he might escape, if necessary, at a moment’s notice.\\nThe natural result was that the fighting spirit of his soldiers was utterly\\nquenched, and when the loyalists made an attack from windward with fire-\\nships, all striving with the utmost ardor to be first in the fray, Huan Hsuan’s\\nforces were routed, had to burn all their baggage and fled for two days and\\nnights without stopping. Chang Yu tells a somewhat similar story of Chao\\nYing-ch‘i, a general of the Chin State who during a battle with the army of\\nCh‘u in 597 B.C. had a boat kept in readiness for him on the river, wishing\\nin case of defeat to be the first to get across.]\\n(3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;\\n[Tu Mu tells us that Yao Hsing, when opposed in 357 A.D. by Huang Mei,\\nTeng Ch‘iang and others shut himself up behind his walls and refused to\\nfight. Teng Ch‘iang said: \\\"Our adversary is of a choleric temper and easily\\nprovoked; let us make constant sallies and break down his walls, then he\\nwill grow angry and come out.

And the inhabitants of Chi-mo, witnessing the out-\\nrage from the city-walls, wept passionately and were all impatient to go out\\nand fight, their fury being increased tenfold. T‘ien Tan knew then that his\\nsoldiers were ready for any enterprise. But instead of a sword, he himself\\ntoo a mattock in his hands, and ordered others to be distributed amongst\\nhis best warriors, while the ranks were filled up with their wives and con-\\ncubines.

In 227 A.D., Meng Ta, governor of Hsin-ch‘eng under the Wei\\nEmperor Wen Ti, was meditating defection to the House of Shu, and had\\nentered into correspondence with Chu-ko Liang, Prime Minister of that\\nState. The Wei general Ssu-ma I was then military governor of Wan, and\\ngetting wind of Meng Ta’s treachery, he at once set off with an army to\\nanticipate his revolt, having previously cajoled him by a specious message\\nof friendly import. Ssu-ma’s officers came to him and said: \\\"If Meng Ta\\nhas leagued himself with Wu and Shu, the matter should be thoroughly\\ninvestigated before we make a move.\\\" Ssu-ma I replied: \\\"Meng Ta is an\\nunprincipled man, and we ought to go and punish him at once, while he is\\nstill wavering and before he has thrown off the mask.\\\" Then, by a series of\\nforced marches, be brought his army under the walls of Hsin-ch‘eng with\\nin a space of eight days. Now Meng Ta had previously said in a letter to\\nChu-ko Liang: \\\"Wan is 1200 LI from here. When the news of my revolt\\nreaches Ssu-ma I, he will at once inform his imperial master, but it will be\\na whole month before any steps can be taken, and by that time my city will\\nbe well fortified. Besides, Ssu-ma I is sure not to come himself, and the\\ngenerals that will be sent against us are not worth troubling about.\\\" The\\nnext letter, however, was filled with consternation: \\\"Though only eight\\ndays have passed since I threw off my allegiance, an army is already at\\nthe city-gates. What miraculous rapidity is this!\\\" A fortnight later, Hsin-\\nch‘eng had fallen and Meng Ta had lost his head. [See CHIN SHU, ch.\\n1, f. 3.] In 621 A.D., Li Ching was sent from K‘uei-chou in Ssu-ch‘uan\\nto reduce the successful rebel Hsiao Hsien, who had set up as Emperor at\\nthe modern Ching-chou Fu in Hupeh. It was autumn, and the Yangtsze\\nbeing then in flood, Hsiao Hsien never dreamt that his adversary would\\nventure to come down through the gorges, and consequently made no pre-\\nparations. But Li Ching embarked his army without loss of time, and was\\njust about to start when the other generals implored him to postpone his\\ndeparture until the river was in a less dangerous state for navigation. Li\\nChing replied: \\\"To the soldier, overwhelming speed is of paramount im-\\nportance, and he must never miss opportunities. Now is the time to strike,\\nbefore Hsiao Hsien even knows that we have got an army together.

He had invaded the Ch‘u State, where a universal levy\\nwas made to oppose him. But, being doubtful of the temper of his troops,\\nhe declined all invitations to fight and remained strictly on the defens-\\nive. In vain did the Ch‘u general try to force a battle: day after day Wang\\nChien kept inside his walls and would not come out, but devoted his whole\\ntime and energy to winning the affection and confidence of his men. He\\ntook care that they should be well fed, sharing his own meals with them,\\nprovided facilities for bathing, and employed every method of judicious\\nindulgence to weld them into a loyal and homogenous body. After some\\ntime had elapsed, he told off certain persons to find out how the men were\\namusing themselves. The answer was, that they were contending with one\\nanother in putting the weight and long-jumping. When Wang Chien heard\\nthat they were engaged in these athletic pursuits, he knew that their spir-\\nits had been strung up to the required pitch and that they were now ready\\nfor fighting. By this time the Ch‘u army, after repeating their challenge\\nagain and again, had marched away eastwards in disgust. The Ch‘in gen-\\neral immediately broke up his camp and followed them, and in the battle\\nthat ensued they were routed with great slaughter. Shortly afterwards, the\\nwhole of Ch‘u was conquered by Ch‘in, and the king Fu-ch‘u led into\\ncaptivity.]\\nKeep your army continually on the move,\\n[In order that the enemy may never know exactly where you are.

The ad-\\nvantage of position neutralizes the inferiority in stamina and courage. Col.\\nHenderson says: \\\"With all respect to the text books, and to the ordinary\\ntactical teaching, I am inclined to think that the study of ground is often\\noverlooked, and that by no means sufficient importance is attached to the\\nselection of positions... and to the immense advantages that are to be de-\\nrived, whether you are defending or attacking, from the proper utilization\\nof natural features.\\\" 2 ]\\n34. Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading\\na single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.\\n[Tu Mu says: \\\"The simile has reference to the ease with which he does\\nit.\\\"]\\n35.

The story runs thus in the HOU HAN SHU, ch. 47: \\\"When Pan\\nCh‘ao arrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the country, received him\\nat first with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards his be-\\nhavior underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss and negligent.\\nPan Ch‘ao spoke about this to the officers of his suite: ’Have you no-\\nticed,’ he said, ’that Kuang’s polite intentions are on the wane? This must\\nsignify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians, and that con-\\nsequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with which side to\\nthrow in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly wise man, we are\\ntold, can perceive things before they have come to pass; how much more,\\nthen, those that are already manifest!’ Thereupon he called one of the nat-\\nives who had been assigned to his service, and set a trap for him, saying:\\n’Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu who arrived some day ago?’\\nThe man was so taken aback that between surprise and fear he presently\\nblurted out the whole truth. Pan Ch‘ao, keeping his informant carefully\\nunder lock and key, then summoned a general gathering of his officers,\\nthirty-six in all, and began drinking with them. When the wine had moun-\\nted into their heads a little, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by\\naddressing them thus: ’Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated\\nregion, anxious to achieve riches and honor by some great exploit. Now it\\nhappens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom\\nonly a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy extended\\ntowards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this envoy prevail\\nupon him to seize our party and hand us over to the Hsiung-no, our bones\\nwill become food for the wolves of the desert. What are we to do?’ With\\none accord, the officers replied: ’Standing as we do in peril of our lives,\\nwe will follow our commander through life and death.’ For the sequel of\\nthis adventure, see chap. XII. ss. 1, note.]\\n52. We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are ac-\\nquainted with their designs.

To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not\\nbefit a warlike prince.\\n54. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows it-\\nself in preventing the concentration of the enemy’s forces. He overawes\\nhis opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.\\n[Mei Tao-ch‘en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so much\\naffected by the Chinese: \\\"In attacking a powerful state, if you can divide\\nher forces, you will have a superiority in strength; if you have a superi-\\nority in strength, you will overawe the enemy; if you overawe the enemy,\\nthe neighboring states will be frightened; and if the neighboring states are\\nfrightened, the enemy’s allies will be prevented from joining her.\\\" The fol-\\nlowing gives a stronger meaning: \\\"If the great state has once been defeated\\n(before she has had time to summon her allies), then the lesser states will\\nhold aloof and refrain from massing their forces.\\\" Ch‘en Hao and Chang\\nYu take the sentence in quite another way. The former says: \\\"Powerful\\nthough a prince may be, if he attacks a large state, he will be unable to\\nraise enough troops, and must rely to some extent on external aid; if he\\ndispenses with this, and with overweening confidence in his own strength,\\nsimply tries to intimidate the enemy, he will surely be defeated.\\\" Chang Yu\\nputs his view thus: \\\"If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people\\nwill be discontented and hang back. But if (as will then be the case) our\\ndisplay of military force is inferior by half to that of the enemy, the other\\nchieftains will take fright and refuse to join us.\\\"]\\n55. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he\\nfoster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs,\\nkeeping his antagonists in awe.\\n[The train of thought, as said by Li Ch‘uan, appears to be this: Secure\\nagainst a combination of his enemies, \\\"he can afford to reject entangling\\nalliances and simply pursue his own secret designs, his prestige enable him\\nto dispense with external friendships.\\\"]\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"V5Ywi/3CzwILM2ubIGjvoqlBepaxwK9Afcgn9fJTV2c=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_111":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_111\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":111,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 12.

In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao,\\nand halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the\\nenemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body\\nof 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red flag.\\nTheir instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles and keep\\na secret watch on the enemy. \\\"When the men of Chao see me in full flight,\\\"\\nHan Hsin said, \\\"they will abandon their fortifications and give chase. This\\nmust be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down the Chao standards and\\nset up the red banners of Han in their stead.\\\" Turning then to his other\\nofficers, he remarked: \\\"Our adversary holds a strong position, and is not\\nlikely to come out and attack us until he sees the standard and drums of\\nthe commander-in-chief, for fear I should turn back and escape through\\nthe mountains.\\\" So saying, he first of all sent out a division consisting of\\n10,000 men, and ordered them to form in line of battle with their backs to\\nthe River Ti. Seeing this maneuver, the whole army of Chao broke into\\nloud laughter. By this time it was broad daylight, and Han Hsin, display-\\ning the generalissimo’s flag, marched out of the pass with drums beating,\\nand was immediately engaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, last-\\ning for some time; until at length Han Hsin and his colleague Chang Ni,\\nleaving drums and banner on the field, fled to the division on the river\\nbank, where another fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to\\npursue them and to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of\\nmen; but the two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was\\nfighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the 2000\\nhorsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men of Chao fol-\\nlowing up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls, tore\\nup the enemy’s flags and replaced them by those of Han. When the Chao\\narmy looked back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags struck them\\nwith terror. Convinced that the Hans had got in and overpowered their\\nking, they broke up in wild disorder, every effort of their leader to stay\\nthe panic being in vain. Then the Han army fell on them from both sides\\nand completed the rout, killing a number and capturing the rest, amongst\\nwhom was King Ya himself.... After the battle, some of Han Hsin’s of-\\nficers came to him and said: \\\"In the ART OF WAR we are told to have\\na hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a river or marsh on the left front.\\n[This appears to be a blend of Sun Tzu and T‘ai Kung.

Simultaneously, a glare of light shot up from the city\\nwalls, and Huang-fu Sung, sounding his drums, led a rapid charge, which\\nthrew the rebels into confusion and put them to headlong flight.\\\" [HOU\\nHAN SHU, ch. 71.] ]\\n10. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the\\nleeward.\\n[Chang Yu, following Tu Yu, says: \\\"When you make a fire, the enemy will\\nretreat away from it; if you oppose his retreat and attack him then, he will\\nfight desperately, which will not conduce to your success.\\\" A rather more\\nobvious explanation is given by Tu Mu: \\\"If the wind is in the east, begin\\nburning to the east of the enemy, and follow up the attack yourself from\\nthat side. If you start the fire on the east side, and then attack from the\\nwest, you will suffer in the same way as your enemy.\\\"]\\n11.

This is\\nthe reason, Chang Yu concludes, why the former is dismissed in a couple\\nof sentences, whereas the attack by fire is discussed in detail. Wu Tzu (ch.\\n4) speaks thus of the two elements: \\\"If an army is encamped on low-lying\\nmarshy ground, from which the water cannot run off, and where the rain-\\nfall is heavy, it may be submerged by a flood. If an army is encamped in\\nwild marsh lands thickly overgrown with weeds and brambles, and visited\\nby frequent gales, it may be exterminated by fire.\\\"]\\n15. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his\\nattacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of\\ntime and general stagnation.\\n[This is one of the most perplexing passages in Sun Tzu. Ts‘ao Kung says:\\n\\\"Rewards for good service should not be deferred a single day.\\\" And Tu\\nMu: \\\"If you do not take opportunity to advance and reward the deserving,\\nyour subordinates will not carry out your commands, and disaster will en-\\nsue.\\\" For several reasons, however, and in spite of the formidable array\\nof scholars on the other side, I prefer the interpretation suggested by Mei\\nYao-ch‘en alone, whose words I will quote: \\\"Those who want to make\\nsure of succeeding in their battles and assaults must seize the favorable\\nmoments when they come and not shrink on occasion from heroic meas-\\nures: that is to say, they must resort to such means of attack of fire, water\\nand the like.

Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the\\ngood general cultivates his resources.\\n[Tu Mu quotes the following from the SAN LUEH, ch. 2: \\\"The warlike\\nprince controls his soldiers by his authority, kits them together by good\\nfaith, and by rewards makes them serviceable. If faith decays, there will\\nbe disruption; if rewards are deficient, commands will not be respected.\\\"]\\n17. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is\\nsomething to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.\\n[Sun Tzu may at times appear to be over-cautious, but he never goes so far\\nin that direction as the remarkable passage in the TAO TE CHING, ch. 69.\\n\\\"I dare not take the initiative, but prefer to act on the defensive; I dare not\\nadvance an inch, but prefer to retreat a foot.\\\"]\\n18.

After each side had experienced a number of victories and defeats, Li\\nHsiung had recourse to the services of a certain P‘o-t‘ai, a native of Wu-tu.\\nHe began to have him whipped until the blood came, and then sent him off\\nto Lo Shang, whom he was to delude by offering to cooperate with him\\nfrom inside the city, and to give a fire signal at the right moment for mak-\\ning a general assault. Lo Shang, confiding in these promises, march out all\\nhis best troops, and placed Wei Po and others at their head with orders to\\nattack at P‘o-t‘ai’s bidding. Meanwhile, Li Hsiung’s general, Li Hsiang,\\nhad prepared an ambuscade on their line of march; and P‘o-t‘ai, having\\nreared long scaling-ladders against the city walls, now lighted the beacon-\\nfire. Wei Po’s men raced up on seeing the signal and began climbing the\\nladders as fast as they could, while others were drawn up by ropes lowered\\nfrom above. More than a hundred of Lo Shang’s soldiers entered the city\\nin this way, every one of whom was forthwith beheaded. Li Hsiung then\\ncharged with all his forces, both inside and outside the city, and routed the\\nenemy completely.\\\" [This happened in 303 A.D. I do not know where Ho\\nShih got the story from. It is not given in the biography of Li Hsiung or\\nthat of his father Li T‘e, CHIN SHU, ch. 120, 121.]\\n11. Having CONVERTED SPIES, getting hold of the enemy’s spies and using\\nthem for our own purposes.\\n[By means of heavy bribes and liberal promises detaching them from the\\nenemy’s service, and inducing them to carry back false information as\\nwell as to spy in turn on their own countrymen. On the other hand, Hsiao\\nShih-hsien says that we pretend not to have detected him, but contrive to\\nlet him carry away a false impression of what is going on. Several of the\\ncommentators accept this as an alternative definition; but that it is not what\\nSun Tzu meant is conclusively proved by his subsequent remarks about\\ntreating the converted spy generously (ss. 21 sqq.). Ho Shih notes three\\noccasions on which converted spies were used with conspicuous success:\\n(1) by T‘ien Tan in his defense of Chi-mo (see supra, p. 90); (2) by Chao\\nShe on his march to O-yu (see p. 57); and by the wily Fan Chu in 260\\nB.C., when Lien P‘o was conducting a defensive campaign against Ch‘in.\\nThe King of Chao strongly disapproved of Lien P‘o’s cautious and dilatory\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"P8PgvQzF66vwzolA7ovA8QjC2ysFopI5wpR7H4BHcPQ=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_126":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_126\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":126,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 14.

They said:\\n\\\"The only thing which causes Ch‘in anxiety is lest Chao Kua should be\\nmade general. Lien P‘o they consider an easy opponent, who is sure to be\\nvanquished in the long run.\\\" Now this Chao Kua was a sun of the famous\\nChao She. From his boyhood, he had been wholly engrossed in the study\\nof war and military matters, until at last he came to believe that there was\\nno commander in the whole Empire who could stand against him. His\\nfather was much disquieted by this overweening conceit, and the flippancy\\nwith which he spoke of such a serious thing as war, and solemnly declared\\nthat if ever Kua was appointed general, he would bring ruin on the armies\\nof Chao. This was the man who, in spite of earnest protests from his own\\nmother and the veteran statesman Lin Hsiang-ju, was now sent to succeed\\nLien P‘o. Needless to say, he proved no match for the redoubtable Po\\nCh‘i and the great military power of Ch‘in. He fell into a trap by which\\nhis army was divided into two and his communications cut; and after a\\ndesperate resistance lasting 46 days, during which the famished soldiers\\ndevoured one another, he was himself killed by an arrow, and his whole\\nforce, amounting, it is said, to 400,000 men, ruthlessly put to the sword.]\\n12. Having DOOMED SPIES, doing certain things openly for purposes of de-\\nception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the\\nenemy.\\n[Tu Yu gives the best exposition of the meaning: \\\"We ostentatiously do\\nthing calculated to deceive our own spies, who must be led to believe that\\nthey have been unwittingly disclosed. Then, when these spies are captured\\nin the enemy’s lines, they will make an entirely false report, and the en-\\nemy will take measures accordingly, only to find that we do something\\nquite different. The spies will thereupon be put to death.\\\" As an example\\nof doomed spies, Ho Shih mentions the prisoners released by Pan Ch‘ao\\nin his campaign against Yarkand. (See p. 132.) He also refers to T‘ang\\nChien, who in 630 A.D. was sent by T‘ai Tsung to lull the Turkish Kahn\\nChieh-li into fancied security, until Li Ching was able to deliver a crushing\\nblow against him. Chang Yu says that the Turks revenged themselves by\\nkilling T‘ang Chien, but this is a mistake, for we read in both the old and\\nthe New T‘ang History (ch. 58, fol. 2 and ch. 89, fol. 8 respectively)\\nthat he escaped and lived on until 656. Li I-chi played a somewhat similar\\npart in 203 B.C., when sent by the King of Han to open peaceful negoti-\\nations with Ch‘i. He has certainly more claim to be described a \\\"doomed\\nspy\\\", for the king of Ch‘i, being subsequently attacked without warning by\\nHan Hsin, and infuriated by what he considered the treachery of Li I-chi,\\nordered the unfortunate envoy to be boiled alive.]\\n13.

He must be active, robust, endowed with physical\\nstrength and courage; thoroughly accustomed to all sorts of dirty work,\\nable to endure hunger and cold, and to put up with shame and ignominy.\\\"\\nHo Shih tells the following story of Ta‘hsi Wu of the Sui dynasty: \\\"When\\nhe was governor of Eastern Ch‘in, Shen-wu of Ch‘i made a hostile move-\\nment upon Sha-yuan. The Emperor T‘ai Tsu [? Kao Tsu] sent Ta-hsi Wu\\nto spy upon the enemy. He was accompanied by two other men. All three\\nwere on horseback and wore the enemy’s uniform. When it was dark, they\\ndismounted a few hundred feet away from the enemy’s camp and stealthily\\ncrept up to listen, until they succeeded in catching the passwords used in\\nthe army. Then they got on their horses again and boldly passed through\\nthe camp under the guise of night-watchmen; and more than once, hap-\\npening to come across a soldier who was committing some breach of dis-\\ncipline, they actually stopped to give the culprit a sound cudgeling! Thus\\nthey managed to return with the fullest possible information about the en-\\nemy’s dispositions, and received warm commendation from the Emperor,\\nwho in consequence of their report was able to inflict a severe defeat on\\nhis adversary.\\\"]\\n14. Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations\\nto be maintained than with spies.\\n[Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch‘en point out that the spy is privileged to enter\\neven the general’s private sleeping-tent.]\\nNone should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should\\ngreater secrecy be preserved.\\n[Tu Mu gives a graphic touch: all communication with spies should be\\ncarried \\\"mouth-to-ear.\\\" The following remarks on spies may be quoted\\nfrom Turenne, who made perhaps larger use of them than any previous\\ncommander: \\\"Spies are attached to those who give them most, he who\\npays them ill is never served. They should never be known to anybody; nor\\nshould they know one another.

It was not a good translation because, according to Dr. Giles, \\\"[I]t contains a\\ngreat deal that Sun Tzu did not write, and very little indeed of what he did.\\\"\\nThe first translation into English was published in 1905 in Tokyo by Capt. E. F.\\nCalthrop, R.F.A. However, this translation is, in the words of Dr. Giles, \\\"excessively\\nbad.\\\" He goes further in this criticism: \\\"It is not merely a question of downright blun-\\nders, from which none can hope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent; hard\\npassages were willfully distorted or slurred over. Such offenses are less pardonable.\\nThey would not be tolerated in any edition of a Latin or Greek classic, and a similar\\nstandard of honesty ought to be insisted upon in translations from Chinese.\\\" In 1908\\na new edition of Capt. Calthrop’s translation was published in London. It was an im-\\nprovement on the first – omissions filled up and numerous mistakes corrected – but\\nnew errors were created in the process. Dr. Giles, in justifying his translation, wrote:\\n\\\"It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate of my own powers; but I could not\\nhelp feeling that Sun Tzu deserved a better fate than had befallen him, and I knew that,\\nat any rate, I could hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors.\\\"\\nClearly, Dr. Giles’ work established much of the groundwork for the work of later\\ntranslators who published their own editions. Of the later editions of the ART OF WAR\\nI have examined; two feature Giles’ edited translation and notes, the other two present\\nthe same basic information from the ancient Chinese commentators found in the Giles\\nedition. Of these four, Giles’ 1910 edition is the most scholarly and presents the reader\\nan incredible amount of information concerning Sun Tzu’s text, much more than any\\nother translation.\\nThe Giles’ edition of the ART OF WAR, as stated above, was a scholarly work.\\nDr. Giles was a leading sinologue at the time and an assistant in the Department of\\nOriental Printed Books and Manuscripts in the British Museum. Apparently he wanted\\nto produce a definitive edition, superior to anything else that existed and perhaps some-\\nthing that would become a standard translation. It was the best translation available for\\n50 years. But apparently there was not much interest in Sun Tzu in English- speaking\\ncountries since it took the start of the Second World War to renew interest in his work.\\nSeveral people published unsatisfactory English translations of Sun Tzu. In 1944, Dr.\\nGiles’ translation was edited and published in the United States in a series of military\\nscience books. But it wasn’t until 1963 that a good English translation (by Samuel B.\\nGriffith and still in print) was published that was an equal to Giles’ translation. While\\nthis translation is more lucid than Dr. Giles’ translation, it lacks his copious notes that\\nmake his so interesting.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3368,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"t6D1B9HZFnf2cUTEfiZpiP2cNLsUmk3rawRSjTW2kSY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"dff6459a-2ff0-4143-b8f3-9727d31975e7":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"dff6459a-2ff0-4143-b8f3-9727d31975e7\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"MDGcnzTt+ny+QM5QsOeXgGc326VVP1+/buQOlYpF9CI=\"}},\"text\":\"CONTENTS 4\\nDr. Giles produced a work primarily intended for scholars of the Chinese civiliza-\\ntion and language.

Sun Tzu: \\\"If\\nwords of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly\\nunderstood, the general is to blame. But if his orders ARE clear, and the\\nsoldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers.\\\"\\nSo saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be beheaded.\\nNow the king of Wu was watching the scene from the top of a raised\\npavilion; and when he saw that his favorite concubines were about to be\\nexecuted, he was greatly alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following\\nmessage: \\\"We are now quite satisfied as to our general’s ability to handle\\ntroops. If We are bereft of these two concubines, our meat and drink will\\nlose their savor. It is our wish that they shall not be beheaded.\\\"\\nSun Tzu replied: \\\"Having once received His Majesty’s commission to\\nbe the general of his forces, there are certain commands of His Majesty\\nwhich, acting in that capacity, I am unable to accept.\\\"\\nAccordingly, he had the two leaders beheaded, and straightway installed\\nthe pair next in order as leaders in their place. When this had been done,\\nthe drum was sounded for the drill once more; and the girls went through\\nall the evolutions, turning to the right or to the left, marching ahead or\\nwheeling back, kneeling or standing, with perfect accuracy and precision,\\nnot venturing to utter a sound. Then Sun Tzu sent a messenger to the King\\nsaying: \\\"Your soldiers, Sire, are now properly drilled and disciplined, and\\nready for your majesty’s inspection. They can be put to any use that their\\nsovereign may desire; bid them go through fire and water, and they will\\nnot disobey.\\\"\\nBut the King replied: \\\"Let our general cease drilling and return to camp.\\nAs for us, We have no wish to come down and inspect the troops.\\\"\\nThereupon Sun Tzu said: \\\"The King is only fond of words, and cannot\\ntranslate them into deeds.\\\"\\nAfter that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tzu was one who knew how to handle an\\narmy, and finally appointed him general. In the west, he defeated the Ch‘u\\nState and forced his way into Ying, the capital; to the north he put fear\\ninto the States of Ch‘i and Chin, and spread his fame abroad amongst the\\nfeudal princes. And Sun Tzu shared in the might of the King.\\nAbout Sun Tzu himself this is all that Ssu-ma Ch‘ien has to tell us in this chapter.

He is mentioned in two other passages of the SHIH\\nCHI:\\nIn the third year of his reign [512 B.C.] Ho Lu, king of Wu, took the\\nfield with Tzu-hsu [i.e. Wu Yuan] and Po P‘ei, and attacked Ch‘u. He\\ncaptured the town of Shu and slew the two prince’s sons who had formerly\\nbeen generals of Wu. He was then meditating a descent on Ying [the\\ncapital]; but the general Sun Wu said: \\\"The army is exhausted. It is not\\nyet possible. We must wait\\\".... [After further successful fighting,] \\\"in the\\nninth year [506 B.C.], King Ho Lu addressed Wu Tzu-hsu and Sun Wu,\\nsaying: \\\"Formerly, you declared that it was not yet possible for us to enter\\nYing. Is the time ripe now?\\\" The two men replied: \\\"Ch‘u’s general Tzu-\\nch‘ang, 4 is grasping and covetous, and the princes of T‘ang and Ts‘ai both\\nhave a grudge against him. If Your Majesty has resolved to make a grand\\nattack, you must win over T‘ang and Ts‘ai, and then you may succeed.\\\"\\nHo Lu followed this advice, [beat Ch‘u in five pitched battles and marched\\ninto Ying.]5\\nThis is the latest date at which anything is recorded of Sun Wu. He does not appear to\\nhave survived his patron, who died from the effects of a wound in 496.\\nIn another chapter there occurs this passage:6\\nFrom this time onward, a number of famous soldiers arose, one after the\\nother: Kao-fan,7 who was employed by the Chin State; Wang-tzu,8 in the\\nservice of Ch‘i; and Sun Wu, in the service of Wu. These men developed\\nand threw light upon the principles of war.\\nIt is obvious enough that Ssu-ma Ch‘ien at least had no doubt about the reality of Sun\\nWu as an historical personage; and with one exception, to be noticed presently, he is\\nby far the most important authority on the period in question. It will not be necessary,\\ntherefore, to say much of such a work as the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU, which is\\nsupposed to have been written by Chao Yeh of the 1st century A.D. The attribution is\\nsomewhat doubtful; but even if it were otherwise, his account would be of little value,\\nbased as it is on the SHIH CHI and expanded with romantic details. The story of Sun\\nTzu will be found, for what it is worth, in chapter 2. The only new points in it worth\\nnoting are: (1) Sun Tzu was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu Tzu-hsu. (2) He is\\ncalled a native of Wu. (3) He had previously lived a retired life, and his contemporaries\\nwere unaware of his ability.\\nThe following passage occurs in the Huai-nan Tzu: \\\"When sovereign and ministers\\nshow perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tzu to encounter the foe.\\\"\\n4The appellation of Nang Wa.\\n5SHI CHI, ch. 31.\\n6SHI CHI, ch. 25.\\n7The appellation of Hu Yen, mentioned in ch. 39 under the year 637.\\n8Wang-tzu Ch‘eng-fu, ch. 32, year 607.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2853,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"ZpsOcvTc/DQTZVJNqgfcHXVAdo9yxPTvuOxzA48c66g=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"96f9a567-7986-4718-a071-6ee2ef4780fd":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"96f9a567-7986-4718-a071-6ee2ef4780fd\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"6h/GdTxpS41jMjhLGNeeBIeeNECm5q/4+Ay6ifKsgd8=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

INTRODUCTION 9\\ntime, Sun Pin lived. He was a descendant of Wu.] 12 In his treatment of\\ndeliberation and planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the field, 13\\nclearness of conception, and depth of design, Sun Tzu stands beyond the\\nreach of carping criticism. My contemporaries, however, have failed to\\ngrasp the full meaning of his instructions, and while putting into practice\\nthe smaller details in which his work abounds, they have overlooked its\\nessential purport. That is the motive which has led me to outline a rough\\nexplanation of the whole.\\nOne thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit statement that the 13 chapters were\\nspecially composed for King Ho Lu. This is supported by the internal evidence of I. ss.\\n15, in which it seems clear that some ruler is addressed.\\nIn the bibliographic section of the HAN SHU, there is an entry which has given\\nrise to much discussion: \\\"The works of Sun Tzu of Wu in 82 P‘IEN (or chapters), with\\ndiagrams in 9 CHUAN.\\\" It is evident that this cannot be merely the 13 chapters known\\nto Ssu-ma Ch‘ien, or those we possess today. Chang Shou-chieh refers to an edition\\nof Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR of which the \\\"13 chapters\\\" formed the first CHUAN,\\nadding that there were two other CHUAN besides. This has brought forth a theory, that\\nthe bulk of these 82 chapters consisted of other writings of Sun Tzu – we should call\\nthem apocryphal – similar to the WEN TA, of which a specimen dealing with the Nine\\nSituations14 is preserved in the T‘UNG TIEN, and another in Ho Shin’s commentary.\\nIt is suggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzu had only written the\\n13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of question and\\nanswer between himself and the King. Pi I-hsun, the author of the SUN TZU HSU\\nLU, backs this up with a quotation from the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU: \\\"The King of\\nWu summoned Sun Tzu, and asked him questions about the art of war. Each time he\\nset forth a chapter of his work, the King could not find words enough to praise him.\\\"\\nAs he points out, if the whole work was expounded on the same scale as in the above-\\nmentioned fragments, the total number of chapters could not fail to be considerable.\\nThen the numerous other treatises attributed to Sun Tzu might be included. The fact\\nthat the HAN CHIH mentions no work of Sun Tzu except the 82 P‘IEN, whereas the\\nSui and T‘ang bibliographies give the titles of others in addition to the \\\"13 chapters,\\\" is\\ngood proof, Pi I-hsun thinks, that all of these were contained in the 82 P‘IEN. Without\\npinning our faith to the accuracy of details supplied by the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU,\\nor admitting the genuineness of any of the treatises cited by Pi I-hsun, we may see in\\nthis theory a probable solution of the mystery. Between Ssu-ma Ch‘ien and Pan Ku\\nthere was plenty of time for a luxuriant crop of forgeries to have grown up under the\\nmagic name of Sun Tzu, and the 82 P‘IEN may very well represent a collected edition\\nof these lumped together with the original work.

This, as Sun Hsing-yen points\\nout, is only a modest way of saying that he made an explanatory paraphrase, or in other\\nwords, wrote a commentary on it. On the whole, this theory has met with very little\\nacceptance. Thus, the SSU K‘U CH‘UAN SHU says: \\\"The mention of the 13 chapters\\nin the SHIH CHI shows that they were in existence before the HAN CHIH, and that\\nlatter accretions are not to be considered part of the original work. Tu Mu’s assertion\\ncan certainly not be taken as proof.\\\"\\nThere is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters existed in the time of\\nSsu-ma Ch‘ien practically as we have them now. That the work was then well known\\nhe tells us in so many words. \\\"Sun Tzu’s 13 Chapters and Wu Ch‘i’s Art of War are the\\ntwo books that people commonly refer to on the subject of military matters. Both of\\nthem are widely distributed, so I will not discuss them here.\\\" But as we go further back,\\nserious difficulties begin to arise. The salient fact which has to be faced is that the TSO\\nCHUAN, the greatest contemporary record, makes no mention whatsoever of Sun Wu,\\neither as a general or as a writer. It is natural, in view of this awkward circumstance,\\nthat many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story of Sun Wu as given in the\\nSHIH CHI, but even show themselves frankly skeptical as to the existence of the man\\nat all. The most powerful presentment of this side of the case is to be found in the\\nfollowing disposition by Yeh Shui-hsin:16\\nIt is stated in Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s history that Sun Wu was a native of the Ch‘i\\nState, and employed by Wu; and that in the reign of Ho Lu he crushed\\nCh‘u, entered Ying, and was a great general. But in Tso’s Commentary no\\nSun Wu appears at all. It is true that Tso’s Commentary need not contain\\nabsolutely everything that other histories contain. But Tso has not omitted\\nto mention vulgar plebeians and hireling ruffians such as Ying K‘ao-shu,17\\nTs‘ao Kuei,18, Chu Chih-wu and Chuan She-chu19. In the case of Sun\\nWu, whose fame and achievements were so brilliant, the omission is much\\nmore glaring. Again, details are given, in their due order, about his con-\\ntemporaries Wu Yuan and the Minister P‘ei.20 Is it credible that Sun Wu\\nalone should have been passed over?\\nIn point of literary style, Sun Tzu’s work belongs to the same school as\\nKUAN TZU,21 LIU T‘AO,22 and the YUEH YU23 and may have been the\\nproduction of some private scholar living towards the end of the \\\"Spring\\nthe case of very short works, one is tempted to think that P‘IEN might simply mean \\\"leaves.\\\"\\n16Yeh Shih of the Sung dynasty [1151-1223].\\n17He hardly deserves to be bracketed with assassins.\\n18See Chapter 7, ss. 27 and Chapter 11, ss. 28.\\n19See Chapter 11, ss. 28.

most\\nshameless offenders in this respect are Wu Ch‘i and Huai-nan Tzu, both of them im-\\nportant historical personages in their day.The former lived only a century after the\\nalleged date of Sun Tzu, and his death is known to have taken place in 381 B.C.It was\\nto him, according to Liu Hsiang, that Tseng Shen delivered the TSO CHUAN, which\\nhad been entrusted to him by its author.28 Now the fact that quotations from the ART\\nOF WAR, acknowledged or otherwise, are to be found in so many authors of differ-\\nent epochs, establishes a very strong anterior to them all, – in other words, that Sun\\nTzu’s treatise was already in existence towards the end of the 5th century B.C.Further\\nproof of Sun Tzu’s antiquity is furnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings\\nattaching to a number of the words he uses.A list of these, which might perhaps be\\nextended, is given in the HSU LU; and though some of the interpretations are doubtful,\\nthe main argument is hardly affected thereby.Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh\\nShui- hsin, a scholar and critic of the first rank, deliberately pronounces the style of the\\n13 chapters to belong to the early part of the fifth century.Seeing that he is actually\\nengaged in an attempt to disprove the existence of Sun Wu himself, we may be sure that\\nhe would not have hesitated to assign the work to a later date had he not honestly be-\\nlieved the contrary.And it is precisely on such a point that the judgment of an educated\\nChinaman will carry most weight.Other internal evidence is not far to seek.Thus in\\nXIII.ss.1, there is an unmistakable allusion to the ancient system of land-tenure which\\nhad already passed away by the time of Mencius, who was anxious to see it revived in\\na modified form.29 The only warfare Sun Tzu knows is that carried on between the\\nvarious feudal princes, in which armored chariots play a large part.Their use seems to\\nhave entirely died out before the end of the Chou dynasty.He speaks as a man of Wu,\\na state which ceased to exist as early as 473 B.C.On this I shall touch presently.But once refer the work to the 5th century or earlier, and the chances of its being\\nother than a bona fide production are sensibly diminished.The great age of forgeries\\ndid not come until long after.That it should have been forged in the period immedi-\\nately following 473 is particularly unlikely, for no one, as a rule, hastens to identify\\nhimself with a lost cause.As for Yeh Shui-hsin’s theory, that the author was a literary\\nrecluse, that seems to me quite untenable.If one thing is more apparent than another\\nafter reading the maxims of Sun Tzu, it is that their essence has been distilled from\\na large store of personal observation and experience.They reflect the mind not only\\nof a born strategist, gifted with a rare faculty of generalization, but also of a practical\\nsoldier closely acquainted with the military conditions of his time.To say nothing of\\nthe fact that these sayings have been accepted and endorsed by all the greatest captains\\nof Chinese history, they offer a combination of freshness and sincerity, acuteness and\\ncommon sense, which quite excludes the idea that they were artificially concocted in\\nthe study.If we admit, then, that the 13 chapters were the genuine production of a\\nmilitary man living towards the end of the \\\"CH‘UN CH‘IU\\\" period, are we not bound,\\nin spite of the silence of the TSO CHUAN, to accept Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s account in its\\nentirety?In view of his high repute as a sober historian,

There is still one grave, if not fatal, objec-\\ntion to the chronology involved in the story as told in the SHIH CHI, which, so far as I\\nam aware, nobody has yet pointed out. There are two passages in Sun Tzu in which he\\nalludes to contemporary affairs. The first in in VI. ss. 21:\\nThough according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in\\nnumber, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say\\nthen that victory can be achieved.\\nThe other is in XI. ss. 30:\\nAsked if an army can be made to imitate the SHUAI-JAN, I should answer,\\nYes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are\\ncrossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come\\nto each other’s assistance just as the left hand helps the right.\\nThese two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of composition.\\nThey assign the work to the period of the struggle between Wu and Yueh. So much\\nhas been observed by Pi I-hsun. But what has hitherto escaped notice is that they also\\nseriously impair the credibility of Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s narrative. As we have seen above,\\nthe first positive date given in connection with Sun Wu is 512 B.C. He is then spoken\\nof as a general, acting as confidential adviser to Ho Lu, so that his alleged introduction\\nto that monarch had already taken place, and of course the 13 chapters must have been\\nwritten earlier still. But at that time, and for several years after, down to the capture\\nof Ying in 506, Ch‘u and not Yueh, was the great hereditary enemy of Wu. The two\\nstates, Ch‘u and Wu, had been constantly at war for over half a century, 30 whereas the\\nfirst war between Wu and Yueh was waged only in 510, 31 and even then was no more\\nthan a short interlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with Ch‘u. Now\\nCh‘u is not mentioned in the 13 chapters at all. The natural inference is that they were\\nwritten at a time when Yueh had become the prime antagonist of Wu, that is, after Ch‘u\\nhad suffered the great humiliation of 506. At this point, a table of dates may be found\\nuseful.\\n30When Wu first appears in the CH‘UN CH‘IU in 584, it is already at variance with its powerful neighbor.\\nThe CH‘UN CH‘IU first mentions Yueh in 537, the TSO CHUAN in 601.\\n31This is explicitly stated in the TSO CHUAN, XXXII, 2.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2454,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"6NYNqjGramhWsju2dGg3xSyUiIAEtpegCOp9i0GUbEQ=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ee23960d-c625-442e-bcd6-49c1dc4f4d93":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ee23960d-c625-442e-bcd6-49c1dc4f4d93\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_15\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LJO1aepJh5AfE1vq3ZXXLQEXdax5tfI4UAE1aJfVb1U=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

It seems rather to imply that, for the moment at\\nleast, the tide had turned against Wu, and that she was getting the worst of the struggle.\\nHence we may conclude that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which\\ndate Yueh does not appear to have scored any notable success against Wu. Ho Lu died\\nin 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must have been during the period\\n505-496, when there was a lull in the hostilities, Wu having presumably exhausted\\nby its supreme effort against Ch‘u. On the other hand, if we choose to disregard the\\ntradition connecting Sun Wu’s name with Ho Lu, it might equally well have seen the\\nlight between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period 482-473, when Yueh was once\\nagain becoming a very serious menace.32 We may feel fairly certain that the author,\\nwhoever he may have been, was not a man of any great eminence in his own day.\\nOn this point the negative testimony of the TSO CHUAN far outweighs any shred of\\nauthority still attaching to the SHIH CHI, if once its other facts are discredited. Sun\\nHsing-yen, however, makes a feeble attempt to explain the omission of his name from\\nthe great commentary. It was Wu Tzu-hsu, he says, who got all the credit of Sun Wu’s\\nexploits, because the latter (being an alien) was not rewarded with an office in the State.\\nHow then did the Sun Tzu legend originate? It may be that the growing celebrity\\nof the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown to its author. It was felt\\nto be only right and proper that one so well versed in the science of war should have\\nsolid achievements to his credit as well. Now the capture of Ying was undoubtedly the\\ngreatest feat of arms in Ho Lu’s reign; it made a deep and lasting impression on all the\\nsurrounding states, and raised Wu to the short-lived zenith of her power.

With this necessary proviso, I should say that he\\nprobably entered the service of Wu about the time of Ho Lu’s accession, and gathered\\nexperience, though only in the capacity of a subordinate officer, during the intense mil-\\nitary activity which marked the first half of the prince’s reign.34 If he rose to be a gen-\\neral at all, he certainly was never on an equal footing with the three above mentioned.\\nHe was doubtless present at the investment and occupation of Ying, and witnessed Wu’s\\nsudden collapse in the following year. Yueh’s attack at this critical juncture, when her\\nrival was embarrassed on every side, seems to have convinced him that this upstart\\nkingdom was the great enemy against whom every effort would henceforth have to be\\ndirected. Sun Wu was thus a well-seasoned warrior when he sat down to write his\\nfamous book, which according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the end,\\nrather than the beginning of Ho Lu’s reign. The story of the women may possibly have\\ngrown out of some real incident occurring about the same time. As we hear no more\\nof Sun Wu after this from any source, he is hardly likely to have survived his patron\\nor to have taken part in the death-struggle with Yueh, which began with the disaster at\\nTsuili.\\nIf these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain irony in the fate\\nwhich decreed that China’s most illustrious man of peace should be contemporary with\\nher greatest writer on war.\\n1.2 The Text of Sun Tzu\\nI have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzu’s text. The quo-\\ntations that occur in early authors go to show that the \\\"13 chapters\\\" of which Ssu-ma\\nCh‘ien speaks were essentially the same as those now extant. We have his word for it\\nthat they were widely circulated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from\\ndiscussing them on that account. Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface:\\nDuring the Ch‘in and Han dynasties Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR was in\\ngeneral use amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated\\nit as a work of mysterious import, and were unwilling to expound it for the\\nbenefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was the first to write\\na commentary on it.\\nAs we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that Ts‘ao Kung\\ntampered with the text. But the text itself is often so obscure, and the number of edi-\\ntions which appeared from that time onward so great, especially during the T‘ang and\\nSung dynasties, that it would be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed\\n33With Wu Yuan himself the case is just the reverse: – a spurious treatise on war has been fathered on him\\nsimply because he was a great general.

Towards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the chief com-\\nmentaries on Sun Tzu were in existence, a certain Chi T‘ien-pao published a work in\\n15 CHUAN entitled \\\"Sun Tzu with the collected commentaries of ten writers.\\\" There\\nwas another text, with variant readings put forward by Chu Fu of Ta-hsing, which also\\nhad supporters among the scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun Hsing-\\nyen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no longer put into circula-\\ntion. Thus, until the end of the 18th century, the text in sole possession of the field\\nwas one derived from Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition, although no actual copy of that import-\\nant work was known to have survived. That, therefore, is the text of Sun Tzu which\\nappears in the War section of the great Imperial encyclopedia printed in 1726, the KU\\nCHIN T‘U SHU CHI CH‘ENG. Another copy at my disposal of what is practically\\nthe same text, with slight variations, is that contained in the \\\"Eleven philosophers of\\nthe Chou and Ch‘in dynasties\\\" [1758]. And the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop’s\\nfirst edition is evidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese channels.\\nSo things remained until Sun Hsing-yen [1752-1818], a distinguished antiquarian and\\nclassical scholar, who claimed to be an actual descendant of Sun Wu,35 accidentally\\ndiscovered a copy of Chi T‘ien-pao’s long-lost work, when on a visit to the library\\nof the Hua-yin temple.36 Appended to it was the I SHUO of Cheng Yu-Hsien, men-\\ntioned in the T‘UNG CHIH, and also believed to have perished. This is what Sun\\nHsing-yen designates as the \\\"original edition (or text)\\\" – a rather misleading name, for\\nit cannot by any means claim to set before us the text of Sun Tzu in its pristine purity.\\nChi T‘ien-pao was a careless compiler, and appears to have been content to reproduce\\nthe somewhat debased version current in his day, without troubling to collate it with\\nthe earliest editions then available. Fortunately, two versions of Sun Tzu, even older\\nthan the newly discovered work, were still extant, one buried in the T‘UNG TIEN, Tu\\nYu’s great treatise on the Constitution, the other similarly enshrined in the T‘AI P‘ING\\nYU LAN encyclopedia. In both the complete text is to be found, though split up into\\nfragments, intermixed with other matter, and scattered piecemeal over a number of dif-\\nferent sections. Considering that the YU LAN takes us back to the year 983, and the\\nT‘UNG TIEN about 200 years further still, to the middle of the T‘ang dynasty, the\\nvalue of these early transcripts of Sun Tzu can hardly be overestimated. Yet the idea of\\nutilizing them does not seem to have occurred to anyone until Sun Hsing-yen, acting\\nunder Government instructions, undertook a thorough recension of the text. This is his\\nown account:\\nBecause of the numerous mistakes in the text of Sun Tzu which his editors\\nhad handed down, the Government ordered that the ancient edition [of\\nChi T‘ien-pao] should be used, and that the text should be revised and\\ncorrected throughout. It happened that Wu Nien-hu, the Governor Pi Kua,\\nand Hsi, a graduate of the second degree, had all devoted themselves to\\n35Preface ad fin: \\\"My family comes from Lo-an, and we are really descended from Sun Tzu.

The commentary which has come down to us under this name\\nis comparatively meager, and nothing about the author is known. Even his per-\\nsonal name has not been recorded. Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition places him after Chia\\nLin,and Ch‘ao Kung- wu also assigns him to the T‘ang dynasty,40 but this is a\\nmistake. In Sun Hsing-yen’s preface, he appears as Meng Shih of the Liang dyn-\\nasty [502-557]. Others would identify him with Meng K‘ang of the 3rd century.\\nHe is named in one work as the last of the \\\"Five Commentators,\\\" the others being\\nWei Wu Ti, Tu Mu, Ch‘en Hao and Chia Lin.\\n3. LI CH‘UAN of the 8th century was a well-known writer on military tactics. One\\nof his works has been in constant use down to the present day. The T‘UNG CHIH\\nmentions \\\"Lives of famous generals from the Chou to the T‘ang dynasty\\\" as\\nwritten by him.41 According to Ch‘ao Kung-wu and the T‘IEN-I-KO catalogue,\\nhe followed a variant of the text of Sun Tzu which differs considerably from\\nthose now extant. His notes are mostly short and to the point, and he frequently\\nillustrates his remarks by anecdotes from Chinese history.\\n4. TU YU (died 812) did not publish a separate commentary on Sun Tzu, his notes\\nbeing taken from the T‘UNG TIEN, the encyclopedic treatise on the Constitution\\nwhich was his life- work. They are largely repetitions of Ts‘ao Kung and Meng\\nShih, besides which it is believed that he drew on the ancient commentaries of\\nWang Ling and others. Owing to the peculiar arrangement of T‘UNG TIEN, he\\nhas to explain each passage on its merits, apart from the context, and sometimes\\nhis own explanation does not agree with that of Ts‘ao Kung, whom he always\\nquotes first. Though not strictly to be reckoned as one of the \\\"Ten Commentat-\\nors,\\\" he was added to their number by Chi T‘ien-pao, being wrongly placed after\\nhis grandson Tu Mu.\\n5. TU MU (803-852) is perhaps the best known as a poet – a bright star even in\\nthe glorious galaxy of the T‘ang period.

His commentary was published with\\na laudatory preface by the great Ou-yang Hsiu, from which we may cull the fol-\\nlowing:\\nLater scholars have misread Sun Tzu, distorting his words and trying to make\\nthem square with their own one-sided views. Thus, though commentators have\\nnot been lacking, only a few have proved equal to the task. My friend Sheng-yu\\nhas not fallen into this mistake. In attempting to provide a critical commentary\\nfor Sun Tzu’s work, he does not lose sight of the fact that these sayings were in-\\ntended for states engaged in internecine warfare; that the author is not concerned\\nwith the military conditions prevailing under the sovereigns of the three ancient\\ndynasties,42 nor with the nine punitive measures prescribed to the Minister of\\nWar.43 Again, Sun Wu loved brevity of diction, but his meaning is always deep.\\nWhether the subject be marching an army, or handling soldiers, or estimating the\\nenemy, or controlling the forces of victory, it is always systematically treated; the\\nsayings are bound together in strict logical sequence, though this has been ob-\\nscured by commentators who have probably failed to grasp their meaning.

The personal name of this commentator is\\ngiven as above by Cheng Ch‘iao in the TUNG CHIH, written about the middle\\nof the twelfth century, but he appears simply as Ho Shih in the YU HAI, and Ma\\nTuan-lin quotes Ch‘ao Kung-wu as saying that his personal name is unknown.\\nThere seems to be no reason to doubt Cheng Ch‘iao’s statement, otherwise I\\nshould have been inclined to hazard a guess and identify him with one Ho Ch‘u-\\nfei, the author of a short treatise on war, who lived in the latter part of the 11th\\ncentury. Ho Shih’s commentary, in the words of the T‘IEN-I-KO catalogue,\\n\\\"contains helpful additions\\\" here and there, but is chiefly remarkable for the\\ncopious extracts taken, in adapted form, from the dynastic histories and other\\nsources.\\n11. CHANG YU. The list closes with a commentator of no great originality perhaps,\\nbut gifted with admirable powers of lucid exposition. His commentator is based\\non that of Ts‘ao Kung, whose terse sentences he contrives to expand and develop\\nin masterly fashion. Without Chang Yu, it is safe to say that much of Ts‘ao\\nKung’s commentary would have remained cloaked in its pristine obscurity and\\ntherefore valueless.

Hence it is that the commentators of Sun\\nTzu in our dynasty belong mainly to that period.46\\nBesides these eleven commentators, there are several others whose work has not come\\ndown to us. The SUI SHU mentions four, namely Wang Ling (often quoted by Tu Yu\\nas Wang Tzu); Chang Tzu- shang; Chia Hsu of Wei;47 and Shen Yu of Wu. The T‘ANG\\nSHU adds Sun Hao, and the T‘UNG CHIH Hsiao Chi, while the T‘U SHU mentions\\na Ming commentator, Huang Jun-yu.

Among the famous generals who are known to have studied his pages with en-\\nthusiasm may be mentioned Han Hsin (d. 196 B.C.),48 Feng I (d. 34 A.D.),49 Lu Meng\\n(d. 219),50 and Yo Fei (1103-1141).51 The opinion of Ts‘ao Kung, who disputes with\\nHan Hsin the highest place in Chinese military annals, has already been recorded.52\\nStill more remarkable, in one way, is the testimony of purely literary men, such as Su\\nHsun (the father of Su Tung-p‘o), who wrote several essays on military topics, all of\\nwhich owe their chief inspiration to Sun Tzu. The following short passage by him is\\npreserved in the YU HAI:53\\nSun Wu’s saying, that in war one cannot make certain of conquering,54 is\\nvery different indeed from what other books tell us.55 Wu Ch‘i was a man\\nof the same stamp as Sun Wu: they both wrote books on war, and they\\nare linked together in popular speech as \\\"Sun and Wu.\\\" But Wu Ch‘i’s\\nremarks on war are less weighty, his rules are rougher and more crudely\\nstated, and there is not the same unity of plan as in Sun Tzu’s work, where\\nthe style is terse, but the meaning fully brought out.\\nThe following is an extract from the \\\"Impartial Judgments in the Garden of Literature\\\"\\nby Cheng Hou:\\n46T‘UNG K‘AO, loc. cit.\\n47A notable person in his day.

His sayings are terse yet elegant, simple yet profound, perspicuous\\nand eminently practical. Such works as the LUN YU, the I CHING and\\nthe great Commentary,56 as well as the writings of Mencius, Hsun K‘uang\\nand Yang Chu, all fall below the level of Sun Tzu.\\nChu Hsi, commenting on this, fully admits the first part of the criticism, although he\\ndislikes the audacious comparison with the venerated classical works. Language of\\nthis sort, he says, \\\"encourages a ruler’s bent towards unrelenting warfare and reckless\\nmilitarism.\\\"\\n1.5 Apologies for War\\nAccustomed as we are to think of China as the greatest peace-loving nation on earth,\\nwe are in some danger of forgetting that her experience of war in all its phases has\\nalso been such as no modern State can parallel. Her long military annals stretch back\\nto a point at which they are lost in the mists of time. She had built the Great Wall\\nand was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries before the first\\nRoman legionary was seen on the Danube. What with the perpetual collisions of the\\nancient feudal States, the grim conflicts with Huns, Turks and other invaders after the\\ncentralization of government, the terrific upheavals which accompanied the overthrow\\nof so many dynasties, besides the countless rebellions and minor disturbances that have\\nflamed up and flickered out again one by one, it is hardly too much to say that the clash\\nof arms has never ceased to resound in one portion or another of the Empire.\\nNo less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom China can\\npoint with pride. As in all countries, the greatest are fond of emerging at the most\\nfateful crises of her history. Thus, Po Ch‘i stands out conspicuous in the period when\\nCh‘in was entering upon her final struggle with the remaining independent states. The\\nstormy years which followed the break-up of the Ch‘in dynasty are illuminated by\\nthe transcendent genius of Han Hsin. When the House of Han in turn is tottering to\\nits fall, the great and baleful figure of Ts‘ao Ts‘ao dominates the scene. And in the\\nestablishment of the T‘ang dynasty,one of the mightiest tasks achieved by man, the\\nsuperhuman energy of Li Shih-min (afterwards the Emperor T‘ai Tsung) was seconded\\nby the brilliant strategy of Li Ching. None of these generals need fear comparison with\\nthe greatest names in the military history of Europe.\\nIn spite of all this, the great body of Chinese sentiment, from Lao Tzu downwards,\\nand especially as reflected in the standard literature of Confucianism, has been consist-\\nently pacific and intensely opposed to militarism in any form. It is such an uncommon\\nthing to find any of the literati defending warfare on principle, that I have thought it\\nworth while to collect and translate a few passages in which the unorthodox view is\\nupheld. The following, by Ssu-ma Ch‘ien, shows that for all his ardent admiration of\\nConfucius, he was yet no advocate of peace at any price:\\n56The TSO CHUAN.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3161,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"e5u9pSINJgiXO7qRzOgpduVrwCQNaSDBZ36vNBKkT6I=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9cf4a84b-3a3f-42a1-9443-d36f76067990":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9cf4a84b-3a3f-42a1-9443-d36f76067990\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":24,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_24\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":24,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"+hgXNrzxdGFrgc/rrbqHdKeQvfGFWFEMDKA48amI8ek=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

The truth is that, just as in the\\nfamily the teacher must not spare the rod, and punishments cannot be dis-\\npensed with in the State, so military chastisement can never be allowed to\\nfall into abeyance in the Empire.

It was the profession of Chung Yu and Jan Ch‘iu, both disciples\\nof Confucius. Nowadays, the holding of trials and hearing of litigation, the\\nimprisonment of offenders and their execution by flogging in the market-\\nplace, are all done by officials. But the wielding of huge armies, the throw-\\ning down of fortified cities, the hauling of women and children into cap-\\ntivity, and the beheading of traitors – this is also work which is done by\\nofficials. The objects of the rack and of military weapons are essentially\\nthe same. There is no intrinsic difference between the punishment of flog-\\nging and cutting off heads in war. For the lesser infractions of law, which\\nare easily dealt with, only a small amount of force need be employed:\\nhence the use of military weapons and wholesale decapitation. In both\\ncases, however, the end in view is to get rid of wicked people, and to give\\ncomfort and relief to the good....\\nChi-sun asked Jan Yu, saying: \\\"Have you, Sir, acquired your military\\naptitude by study, or is it innate?\\\" Jan Yu replied: \\\"It has been acquired\\nby study.\\\"58 \\\"How can that be so,\\\" said Chi-sun, \\\"seeing that you are a\\ndisciple of Confucius?\\\" \\\"It is a fact,\\\" replied Jan Yu; \\\"I was taught by\\nConfucius.

When Confucius held office under the Duke\\nof Lu, and a meeting was convened at Chia-ku,60 he said: \\\"If pacific ne-\\ngotiations are in progress, warlike preparations should have been made\\nbeforehand.\\\" He rebuked and shamed the Marquis of Ch‘i, who cowered\\nunder him and dared not proceed to violence. How can it be said that these\\ntwo great Sages had no knowledge of military matters?\\nWe have seen that the great Chu Hsi held Sun Tzu in high esteem. He also appeals to\\nthe authority of the Classics:\\nOur Master Confucius, answering Duke Ling of Wei, said: \\\"I have never\\nstudied matters connected with armies and battalions.\\\"61 Replying to K‘ung\\nWen-tzu, he said: I have not been instructed about buff-coats and weapons.\\\"\\nBut if we turn to the meeting at Chia-ku, we find that he used armed force\\nagainst the men of Lai, so that the marquis of Ch‘i was overawed.

He once uttered the\\nwords: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\"62 And Jan Yu also said: \\\"The Sage exercises\\nboth civil and military functions.\\\"63 Can it be a fact that Confucius never\\nstudied or received instruction in the art of war?

But if one can command\\nthe services of a good general like Sun Tzu, who was employed by Wu\\nTzu-hsu, there is no need to learn it oneself. Hence the remark added by\\nConfucius: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\"\\nThe men of the present day, however, willfully interpret these words of\\nConfucius in their narrowest sense, as though he meant that books on the\\nart of war were not worth reading. With blind persistency, they adduce the\\nexample of Chao Kua, who pored over his father’s books to no purpose,66\\nas a proof that all military theory is useless.

Chi got\\na rough idea of the art in its general bearings, but would not pursue his\\nstudies to their proper outcome, the consequence being that he was finally\\ndefeated and overthrown. He did not realize that the tricks and artifices\\nof war are beyond verbal computation. Duke Hsiang of Sung and King\\nYen of Hsu were brought to destruction by their misplaced humanity. The\\ntreacherous and underhand nature of war necessitates the use of guile and\\nstratagem suited to the occasion. There is a case on record of Confucius\\nhimself having violated an extorted oath,71 and also of his having left the\\nSung State in disguise.72 Can we then recklessly arraign Sun Tzu for dis-\\nregarding truth and honesty?\\n66See XIII. ss. 11, note.\\n67This is a rather obscure allusion to the TSO CHUAN, where Tzu-ch‘an says: \\\"If you have a piece of\\nbeautiful brocade, you will not employ a mere learner to make it up.\\\"\\n68Cf.

Ho\\nShih says: \\\"Haste may be stupid, but at any rate it saves expenditure of\\nenergy and treasure; protracted operations may be very clever, but they\\nbring calamity in their train.\\\" Wang Hsi evades the difficulty by remark-\\ning: \\\"Lengthy operations mean an army growing old, wealth being expen-\\nded, an empty exchequer and distress among the people; true cleverness\\ninsures against the occurrence of such calamities.\\\" Chang Yu says: \\\"So\\nlong as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable to clever dilat-\\noriness.\\\" Now Sun Tzu says nothing whatever, except possibly by implic-\\nation, about ill-considered haste being better than ingenious but lengthy\\noperations. What he does say is something much more guarded, namely\\nthat, while speed may sometimes be injudicious, tardiness can never be\\nanything but foolish – if only because it means impoverishment to the na-\\ntion. In considering the point raised here by Sun Tzu, the classic example\\nof Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur to the mind.

Wei Liao Tzu [4th cent. B.C.] says: ’Direct warfare\\nfavors frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.’ Ts‘ao Kung\\nsays: ’Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation; appearing on\\nthe enemy’s rear is an indirect maneuver.’ Li Wei-kung [6th and 7th cent.\\nA.D.] says: ’In war, to march straight ahead is CHENG; turning move-\\nments, on the other hand, are CH‘I.’ These writers simply regard CHENG\\nas CHENG, and CH‘I as CH‘I; they do not note that the two are mutually\\ninterchangeable and run into each other like the two sides of a circle [see\\ninfra, ss. 11]. A comment on the T‘ang Emperor T‘ai Tsung goes to the\\nroot of the matter: ’A CH‘I maneuver may be CHENG, if we make the\\nenemy look upon it as CHENG; then our real attack will be CH‘I, and vice\\nversa. The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot\\nfathom our real intent.’\\\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack\\nor other operation is CHENG, on which the enemy has had his attention\\nfixed; whereas that is CH‘I,\\\" which takes him by surprise or comes from\\nan unexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant\\nto be CH‘I,\\\" it immediately becomes CHENG.\\\"]\\n4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an\\negg - this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.\\n5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect\\nmethods will be needed in order to secure victory.\\n[Chang Yu says: \\\"Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding\\nthe enemy’s flanks or falling on his rear.\\\" A brilliant example of \\\"indirect\\ntactics\\\" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord Roberts’ night\\nmarch round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.1\\n6.

Of course, as has already been pointed out,\\nthe two are so inextricably interwoven in all military operations, that they\\ncannot really be considered apart.

Sun Pin said: \\\"The Ch‘i State has a reputation\\nfor cowardice, and therefore our adversary despises us. Let us turn this\\ncircumstance to account.\\\" Accordingly, when the army had crossed the\\nborder into Wei territory, he gave orders to show 100,000 fires on the first\\nnight, 50,000 on the next, and the night after only 20,000. P‘ang Chuan\\npursued them hotly, saying to himself: \\\"I knew these men of Ch‘i were\\ncowards: their numbers have already fallen away by more than half.\\\" In\\nhis retreat, Sun Pin came to a narrow defile, with he calculated that his\\npursuers would reach after dark. Here he had a tree stripped of its bark,\\nand inscribed upon it the words: \\\"Under this tree shall P‘ang Chuan die.\\\"\\nThen, as night began to fall, he placed a strong body of archers in ambush\\nnear by, with orders to shoot directly they saw a light. Later on, P‘ang\\nChuan arrived at the spot, and noticing the tree, struck a light in order to\\nread what was written on it. His body was immediately riddled by a volley\\nof arrows, and his whole army thrown into confusion. [The above is Tu\\nMu’s version of the story; the SHIH CHI, less dramatically but probably\\nwith more historical truth, makes P‘ang Chuan cut his own throat with an\\nexclamation of despair, after the rout of his army.] ]\\nHe sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.\\n20.

The King of\\nChao first consulted Lien P‘o on the advisability of attempting a relief,\\nbut the latter thought the distance too great, and the intervening country\\ntoo rugged and difficult.

In 227 A.D., Meng Ta, governor of Hsin-ch‘eng under the Wei\\nEmperor Wen Ti, was meditating defection to the House of Shu, and had\\nentered into correspondence with Chu-ko Liang, Prime Minister of that\\nState. The Wei general Ssu-ma I was then military governor of Wan, and\\ngetting wind of Meng Ta’s treachery, he at once set off with an army to\\nanticipate his revolt, having previously cajoled him by a specious message\\nof friendly import. Ssu-ma’s officers came to him and said: \\\"If Meng Ta\\nhas leagued himself with Wu and Shu, the matter should be thoroughly\\ninvestigated before we make a move.\\\" Ssu-ma I replied: \\\"Meng Ta is an\\nunprincipled man, and we ought to go and punish him at once, while he is\\nstill wavering and before he has thrown off the mask.\\\" Then, by a series of\\nforced marches, be brought his army under the walls of Hsin-ch‘eng with\\nin a space of eight days. Now Meng Ta had previously said in a letter to\\nChu-ko Liang: \\\"Wan is 1200 LI from here. When the news of my revolt\\nreaches Ssu-ma I, he will at once inform his imperial master, but it will be\\na whole month before any steps can be taken, and by that time my city will\\nbe well fortified. Besides, Ssu-ma I is sure not to come himself, and the\\ngenerals that will be sent against us are not worth troubling about.\\\" The\\nnext letter, however, was filled with consternation: \\\"Though only eight\\ndays have passed since I threw off my allegiance, an army is already at\\nthe city-gates. What miraculous rapidity is this!\\\" A fortnight later, Hsin-\\nch‘eng had fallen and Meng Ta had lost his head. [See CHIN SHU, ch.\\n1, f. 3.] In 621 A.D., Li Ching was sent from K‘uei-chou in Ssu-ch‘uan\\nto reduce the successful rebel Hsiao Hsien, who had set up as Emperor at\\nthe modern Ching-chou Fu in Hupeh. It was autumn, and the Yangtsze\\nbeing then in flood, Hsiao Hsien never dreamt that his adversary would\\nventure to come down through the gorges, and consequently made no pre-\\nparations. But Li Ching embarked his army without loss of time, and was\\njust about to start when the other generals implored him to postpone his\\ndeparture until the river was in a less dangerous state for navigation. Li\\nChing replied: \\\"To the soldier, overwhelming speed is of paramount im-\\nportance, and he must never miss opportunities.

He had invaded the Ch‘u State, where a universal levy\\nwas made to oppose him. But, being doubtful of the temper of his troops,\\nhe declined all invitations to fight and remained strictly on the defens-\\nive.

He\\ntook care that they should be well fed, sharing his own meals with them,\\nprovided facilities for bathing, and employed every method of judicious\\nindulgence to weld them into a loyal and homogenous body. After some\\ntime had elapsed, he told off certain persons to find out how the men were\\namusing themselves. The answer was, that they were contending with one\\nanother in putting the weight and long-jumping. When Wang Chien heard\\nthat they were engaged in these athletic pursuits, he knew that their spir-\\nits had been strung up to the required pitch and that they were now ready\\nfor fighting. By this time the Ch‘u army, after repeating their challenge\\nagain and again, had marched away eastwards in disgust. The Ch‘in gen-\\neral immediately broke up his camp and followed them, and in the battle\\nthat ensued they were routed with great slaughter. Shortly afterwards, the\\nwhole of Ch‘u was conquered by Ch‘in, and the king Fu-ch‘u led into\\ncaptivity.]\\nKeep your army continually on the move,\\n[In order that the enemy may never know exactly where you are.

This must\\nsignify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians, and that con-\\nsequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with which side to\\nthrow in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly wise man, we are\\ntold, can perceive things before they have come to pass; how much more,\\nthen, those that are already manifest!’ Thereupon he called one of the nat-\\nives who had been assigned to his service, and set a trap for him, saying:\\n’Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu who arrived some day ago?’\\nThe man was so taken aback that between surprise and fear he presently\\nblurted out the whole truth. Pan Ch‘ao, keeping his informant carefully\\nunder lock and key, then summoned a general gathering of his officers,\\nthirty-six in all, and began drinking with them. When the wine had moun-\\nted into their heads a little, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by\\naddressing them thus: ’Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated\\nregion, anxious to achieve riches and honor by some great exploit. Now it\\nhappens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom\\nonly a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy extended\\ntowards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this envoy prevail\\nupon him to seize our party and hand us over to the Hsiung-no, our bones\\nwill become food for the wolves of the desert.

To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not\\nbefit a warlike prince.\\n54. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows it-\\nself in preventing the concentration of the enemy’s forces. He overawes\\nhis opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.\\n[Mei Tao-ch‘en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so much\\naffected by the Chinese: \\\"In attacking a powerful state, if you can divide\\nher forces, you will have a superiority in strength; if you have a superi-\\nority in strength, you will overawe the enemy; if you overawe the enemy,\\nthe neighboring states will be frightened; and if the neighboring states are\\nfrightened, the enemy’s allies will be prevented from joining her.\\\" The fol-\\nlowing gives a stronger meaning: \\\"If the great state has once been defeated\\n(before she has had time to summon her allies), then the lesser states will\\nhold aloof and refrain from massing their forces.\\\" Ch‘en Hao and Chang\\nYu take the sentence in quite another way. The former says: \\\"Powerful\\nthough a prince may be, if he attacks a large state, he will be unable to\\nraise enough troops, and must rely to some extent on external aid; if he\\ndispenses with this, and with overweening confidence in his own strength,\\nsimply tries to intimidate the enemy, he will surely be defeated.\\\" Chang Yu\\nputs his view thus: \\\"If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people\\nwill be discontented and hang back. But if (as will then be the case) our\\ndisplay of military force is inferior by half to that of the enemy, the other\\nchieftains will take fright and refuse to join us.\\\"]\\n55. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he\\nfoster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs,\\nkeeping his antagonists in awe.\\n[The train of thought, as said by Li Ch‘uan, appears to be this: Secure\\nagainst a combination of his enemies, \\\"he can afford to reject entangling\\nalliances and simply pursue his own secret designs, his prestige enable him\\nto dispense with external friendships.\\\"]\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2959,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"DwFg3Q2sRSP88cbwtnvcAwl054yBBOTEOx4hd/UjZis=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5b5f1bfa-3e2a-4255-88aa-761cc75daf17":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5b5f1bfa-3e2a-4255-88aa-761cc75daf17\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":111,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_111\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":111,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"Lu6QoTVu2ihg2Km2gnKCD+6TqXV/U5ESUEet2Gut5YQ=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 12.

THE NINE SITUATIONS 111\\n[These words of Sun Tzu were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation\\nof the tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already al-\\nluded to on p. 28. In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao,\\nand halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the\\nenemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body\\nof 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red flag.\\nTheir instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles and keep\\na secret watch on the enemy. \\\"When the men of Chao see me in full flight,\\\"\\nHan Hsin said, \\\"they will abandon their fortifications and give chase. This\\nmust be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down the Chao standards and\\nset up the red banners of Han in their stead.\\\" Turning then to his other\\nofficers, he remarked: \\\"Our adversary holds a strong position, and is not\\nlikely to come out and attack us until he sees the standard and drums of\\nthe commander-in-chief, for fear I should turn back and escape through\\nthe mountains.\\\" So saying, he first of all sent out a division consisting of\\n10,000 men, and ordered them to form in line of battle with their backs to\\nthe River Ti. Seeing this maneuver, the whole army of Chao broke into\\nloud laughter. By this time it was broad daylight, and Han Hsin, display-\\ning the generalissimo’s flag, marched out of the pass with drums beating,\\nand was immediately engaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, last-\\ning for some time; until at length Han Hsin and his colleague Chang Ni,\\nleaving drums and banner on the field, fled to the division on the river\\nbank, where another fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to\\npursue them and to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of\\nmen; but the two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was\\nfighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the 2000\\nhorsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men of Chao fol-\\nlowing up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls, tore\\nup the enemy’s flags and replaced them by those of Han. When the Chao\\narmy looked back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags struck them\\nwith terror. Convinced that the Hans had got in and overpowered their\\nking, they broke up in wild disorder, every effort of their leader to stay\\nthe panic being in vain. Then the Han army fell on them from both sides\\nand completed the rout, killing a number and capturing the rest, amongst\\nwhom was King Ya himself.... After the battle, some of Han Hsin’s of-\\nficers came to him and said: \\\"In the ART OF WAR we are told to have\\na hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a river or marsh on the left front.\\n[This appears to be a blend of Sun Tzu and T‘ai Kung. See IX ss. 9, and\\nnote.] You, on the contrary, ordered us to draw up our troops with the\\nriver at our back. Under these conditions, how did you manage to gain\\nthe victory?\\\" The general replied: \\\"I fear you gentlemen have not stud-\\nied the Art of War with sufficient care.

This is\\nthe reason, Chang Yu concludes, why the former is dismissed in a couple\\nof sentences, whereas the attack by fire is discussed in detail. Wu Tzu (ch.\\n4) speaks thus of the two elements: \\\"If an army is encamped on low-lying\\nmarshy ground, from which the water cannot run off, and where the rain-\\nfall is heavy, it may be submerged by a flood.

He also refers to T‘ang\\nChien, who in 630 A.D. was sent by T‘ai Tsung to lull the Turkish Kahn\\nChieh-li into fancied security, until Li Ching was able to deliver a crushing\\nblow against him.

They\\nfeed on small animals, such as frogs and lizards, eggs and\\nyoung of other birds, insects, and (particularly in winter)\\ngrains, nuts, and berries. They will also eat fruit and vegetables\\ngrowing in backyards.[4][3]\\nCalifornia scrub jays, like many other corvids, exploit ephemeral surpluses by storing food in scattered\\ncaches within their territories. They rely on highly accurate and complex memories to recover the hidden\\ncaches, often after long periods of time.[5] In the process of collecting and storing this food, they have\\nshown an ability to plan ahead in choosing cache sites to provide adequate food volume and variety for\\nthe future.[6] Western scrub jays are also able to rely on their accurate observational spatial memories to\\nsteal food from caches made by conspecifics. Food-storing birds implement a number of strategies to\\nprotect their caches from potential 'pilferers.'[7][8]\\nAnecdotally, scrub jays – and corvids more generally – are known for an attraction to, and thievery of,\\nbrightly colored objects. Recent research debunks, or at least casts doubt, on this idea.[9][10][11] Corvids\\ndo, however, have a mischievous streak, and scrub jays are not above outright theft. They have been\\nobserved stealing acorns from acorn woodpecker caches. Some scrub jays snatch acorns from the hiding\\nplaces of other jays. When these birds go to hide their own acorns, they check first that no other jays are\\nwatching. Other protection methods include moving the cache in the presence of an observer, storing\\ninedible decoys like small stones instead of food, and hiding the cache once a scavenging bird is no\\nlonger watching;[12] these behaviors are thought to vary based on the presence or absence of potential\\npilferers (like other corvids) as well as what kind of animal might pilfer the cache, implying strategic and\\nsocially complex motives behind different kinds of caching behavior. [12][13]\\nRecent research has suggested that western scrub jays, along with several other corvids, are among the\\nmost intelligent of animals. The brain-to-body mass ratio of adult scrub jays rivals that of chimpanzees\\nand cetaceans, and is dwarfed only by that of humans. Scrub jays are also the only non-primate or non-\\ndolphin shown to plan ahead for the future (known as metacognition), which was previously thought of as\\na uniquely human trait.[14] Other studies have shown that they can remember locations of over 200 food\\ncaches, as well as the food item in each cache and its rate of decay.[15] To protect their caches from\\npilfering conspecifics, scrub jays will choose locations out of sight of their competitors, or re-cache\\ncaches once they are alone, suggesting that they can take into account the perspective of others.[7]\\nForaging\\nFood storing\\nIntelligence\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"DqXH33Yz8ug6mJLZZDY73DvOtpiQ1yK8hOlE+W53N4Q=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/1735865721159-California_scrub_jay.pdf_3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/1735865721159-California_scrub_jay.pdf_3\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"total_pages\":8,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865721159-California_scrub_jay.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865721159-California_scrub_jay.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Juvenile in California, USA\\nJays are able to mimic raptors like red-tailed and red-shouldered hawks with such accuracy that is can be\\ndifficult to distinguish between species using calls alone; possible explanations for this behavior include\\nwarning other jays about the presence of a predator or trying to deter birds (like cache-pilfering corvids)\\nfrom a given area.[16] However, jays have been observed employing raptor-mimicking calls without the\\npresence of other birds, making the precise adaptive reason for this behavior unknown, though it may be\\ntwo-fold.[17] California scrub jays also summon others to screech over the body of a dead jay, according\\nto research from the University of California, Davis.

It ranges\\nfrom southern British Columbia throughout California and\\nwestern Nevada near Reno to west of the Sierra Nevada. The\\nCalifornia scrub jay was once lumped with Woodhouse's scrub\\njay and collectively called the western scrub jay. The group\\nwas also lumped with the island scrub jay and the Florida scrub\\njay; the taxon was then called simply scrub jay.[2] The\\nCalifornia scrub jay is nonmigratory and can be found in urban\\nareas, where it can become tame and will come to bird feeders.\\nWhile many refer to scrub jays as \\\"blue jays\\\", the blue jay is a\\ndifferent species of bird entirely.\\nThe generic name, Aphelocoma, derives from Latinized\\nAncient Greek apheles- (from ἀφελής-) \\\"simple\\\" + Latin coma\\n(from Greek kome κόμη) \\\"hair\\\", in reference to the lack of\\nstriped or banded feathers in this genus, compared to other\\njays. The species name, californica, is Latin for \\\"from\\nCalifornia\\\".\\nThe California scrub jay is a medium-sized bird, approximately\\n27–31 cm (11–12 in) in length (including its tail), with a 39 cm\\n(15 in) wingspan, and about 80 g (2.8 oz) in weight. In general,\\nthis species has a blue head, wings, and tail; a gray-brown\\nback; grayish underparts; and white eyebrows. The throat is\\nwhitish with a blue necklace.

It also inhabits suburban\\ngardens.[3]\\nCalifornia scrub jays usually forage in pairs, family groups, or\\nsmall non-kin groups, outside of the breeding season. They\\nfeed on small animals, such as frogs and lizards, eggs and\\nyoung of other birds, insects, and (particularly in winter)\\ngrains, nuts, and berries. They will also eat fruit and vegetables\\ngrowing in backyards.[4][3]\\nCalifornia scrub jays, like many other corvids, exploit ephemeral surpluses by storing food in scattered\\ncaches within their territories. They rely on highly accurate and complex memories to recover the hidden\\ncaches, often after long periods of time.[5] In the process of collecting and storing this food, they have\\nshown an ability to plan ahead in choosing cache sites to provide adequate food volume and variety for\\nthe future.[6] Western scrub jays are also able to rely on their accurate observational spatial memories to\\nsteal food from caches made by conspecifics. Food-storing birds implement a number of strategies to\\nprotect their caches from potential 'pilferers.'[7][8]\\nAnecdotally, scrub jays – and corvids more generally – are known for an attraction to, and thievery of,\\nbrightly colored objects. Recent research debunks, or at least casts doubt, on this idea.[9][10][11] Corvids\\ndo, however, have a mischievous streak, and scrub jays are not above outright theft. They have been\\nobserved stealing acorns from acorn woodpecker caches. Some scrub jays snatch acorns from the hiding\\nplaces of other jays. When these birds go to hide their own acorns, they check first that no other jays are\\nwatching. Other protection methods include moving the cache in the presence of an observer, storing\\ninedible decoys like small stones instead of food, and hiding the cache once a scavenging bird is no\\nlonger watching;[12] these behaviors are thought to vary based on the presence or absence of potential\\npilferers (like other corvids) as well as what kind of animal might pilfer the cache, implying strategic and\\nsocially complex motives behind different kinds of caching behavior. [12][13]\\nRecent research has suggested that western scrub jays, along with several other corvids, are among the\\nmost intelligent of animals. The brain-to-body mass ratio of adult scrub jays rivals that of chimpanzees\\nand cetaceans, and is dwarfed only by that of humans. Scrub jays are also the only non-primate or non-\\ndolphin shown to plan ahead for the future (known as metacognition), which was previously thought of as\\na uniquely human trait.[14] Other studies have shown that they can remember locations of over 200 food\\ncaches, as well as the food item in each cache and its rate of decay.[15] To protect their caches from\\npilfering conspecifics, scrub jays will choose locations out of sight of their competitors, or re-cache\\ncaches once they are alone, suggesting that they can take into account the perspective of others.[7]\\nForaging\\nFood storing\\nIntelligence\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3087,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"pvOClJ2lV3X/+J2w3fZmRhUQCLViGZ7UNG9EaKRytA4=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"1e2a40cb-35f6-4f33-8a73-86ebae760269":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"1e2a40cb-35f6-4f33-8a73-86ebae760269\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"total_pages\":8,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865721159-California_scrub_jay.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865721159-California_scrub_jay.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865721159-California_scrub_jay.pdf_3\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":3,\"total_pages\":8,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865721159-California_scrub_jay.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865721159-California_scrub_jay.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"uS9li2jldDQZiRUr3/20qBww5A2cWG3qmqaAXBQVzFU=\"}},\"text\":\"Juvenile in California, USA\\nJays are able to mimic raptors like red-tailed and red-shouldered hawks with such accuracy that is can be\\ndifficult to distinguish between species using calls alone; possible explanations for this behavior include\\nwarning other jays about the presence of a predator or trying to deter birds (like cache-pilfering corvids)\\nfrom a given area.[16] However, jays have been observed employing raptor-mimicking calls without the\\npresence of other birds, making the precise adaptive reason for this behavior unknown, though it may be\\ntwo-fold.[17] California scrub jays also summon others to screech over the body of a dead jay, according\\nto research from the University of California, Davis. The birds' cacophonous \\\"funerals\\\" can last for up to\\nhalf an hour.[18][19]\\nNests are built low in trees or bushes, 1–10 m (3.3–32.8 ft) above\\nthe ground, primarily by the female, while the male guards her\\nefforts. The nests are sturdy, with an outside diameter of 33–58 cm\\n(13–23 in), constructed on a platform of twigs with moss and dry\\ngrasses lined with fine roots and hair. Four to six eggs are laid\\nfrom March through July, with some regional variations. There are\\ntwo common shell color variations: pale green with irregular,\\nolive-colored spots or markings; and pale grayish-white to green\\nwith reddish-brown spots. The female incubates the eggs for about\\n16 days. The young leave the nest about 18 days after hatching.\\nThe life span of wild California scrub jays is approximately 9 years.

But, he assured me, since I had already made the move,\\nhe would tell me how to correct my mistake.\\nIn what I next relate, bear in mind that Charlie and his family did not have a\\ndime invested in the small investing partnership that I was then managing and whose\\nmoney I had used for the Berkshire purchase. Moreover, neither of us expected that\\nCharlie would ever own a share of Berkshire stock.\\nNevertheless, Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: “Warren, forget about\\never buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add\\nto it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses\\nat wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero,\\nBen Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.” With much back-sliding\\nI subsequently followed his instructions.\\nMany years later, Charlie became my partner in running Berkshire and,\\nrepeatedly, jerked me back to sanity when my old habits surfaced. Until his death, he\\ncontinued in this role and together we, along with those who early on invested with\\nus, ended up far better off than Charlie and I had ever dreamed possible.\\nIn reality, Charlie was the “architect” of the present Berkshire, and I acted as\\nthe “general contractor” to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision.\\nCharlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me\\ntake the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part\\nolder brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the\\nreins, and when I blundered he never – never –reminded me of my mistake.\\nIn the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those\\nwho had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten.

It is filled with a vast amount of information – some important, some trivial.\\nAmong its disclosures many owners, along with financial reporters, will focus on page\\nK-72. There, they will find the proverbial “bottom line” labeled “Net earnings (loss).” The\\nnumbers read $90 billion for 2021, ($23 billion) for 2022 and $96 billion for 2023.\\nWhat in the world is going on?\\nYou seek guidance and are told that the procedures for calculating these “earnings” are\\npromulgated by a sober and credentialed Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”),\\nmandated by a dedicated and hard-working Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and\\naudited by the world-class professionals at Deloitte & Touche (“D&T”). On page K-67, D&T pulls\\nno punches: “In our opinion, the financial statements . . . . . present fairly, in all material respects\\n(italics mine), the financial position of the Company . . . . . and the results of its operations . . . . .\\nfor each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 . . . . .”\\nSo sanctified, this worse-than-useless “net income” figure quickly gets transmitted\\nthroughout the world via the internet and media. All parties believe they have done their job – and,\\nlegally, they have.\\nWe, however, are left uncomfortable. At Berkshire, our view is that “earnings” should be a\\nsensible concept that Bertie will find somewhat useful – but only as a starting point – in\\nevaluating a business. Accordingly, Berkshire also reports to Bertie and you what we call\\n“operating earnings.” Here is the story they tell: $27.6 billion for 2021; $30.9 billion for 2022 and\\n$37.4 billion for 2023.\\n4\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2582,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"+f1tDMrpzSrmAV9YslOurZD32ew46DEUkrNsoe6yGdQ=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c21cdb66-baa7-4ca9-9797-825fd18e6199":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c21cdb66-baa7-4ca9-9797-825fd18e6199\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":4,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_4\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":4,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"+BoBJ+JaMgLYRTeH33GgTyDl8qCNkMFS+shfTsYyXas=\"}},\"text\":\"The primary difference between the mandated figures and the ones Berkshire prefers is that\\nwe exclude unrealized capital gains or losses that at times can exceed $5 billion a day. Ironically,\\nour preference was pretty much the rule until 2018, when the “improvement” was mandated.\\nGalileo’s experience, several centuries ago, should have taught us not to mess with mandates from\\non high. But, at Berkshire, we can be stubborn.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nMake no mistake about the significance of capital gains: I expect them to be a very\\nimportant component of Berkshire’s value accretion during the decades ahead. Why else would\\nwe commit huge dollar amounts of your money (and Bertie’s) to marketable equities just as I have\\nbeen doing with my own funds throughout my investing lifetime?\\nI can’t remember a period since March 11, 1942 – the date of my first stock purchase – that\\nI have not had a majority of my net worth in equities, U.S.-based equities.

People are not that easy to read. Sincerity and empathy can easily be faked.

I erred, however, in my expectations for both BNSF\\nand BHE. Let’s take a look at each.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nRail is essential to America’s economic future. It is clearly the most efficient\\nway – measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity – of moving heavy materials to distant\\ndestinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must travel to\\ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can’t run without\\nrail, and the industry’s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American\\nbusinesses, railroads eat capital.\\nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad\\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted\\nother fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least\\n$500 billion to replicate those assets and decades to complete the job.\\nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain its present\\nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested,\\nbut it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries.\\nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years\\nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $1 1⁄2 billion annually. Ouch! That sort of\\ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall considerably short of\\nBNSF’s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad’s debt. And that we do not\\nintend to do.\\nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less\\nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That’s no\\nsurprise to me or Berkshire’s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a\\nsmall fraction of its replacement value.\\nNorth America’s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and\\nexported goods, etc. one-way for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for\\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization\\nof track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I\\nsit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees\\nworking under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions.\\nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the\\ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must\\ndeal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or\\nmentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car,\\nextraordinarily heavy train that can’t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be\\nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more\\ncommon in Europe and will always be with us.\\n12\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3108,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"shkCItvHp+ukOIBBB6gSY33myRGBwN2/NcyCIUaXok0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c112f94d-c81e-4292-a8fe-1c4491826a5b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c112f94d-c81e-4292-a8fe-1c4491826a5b\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_12\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"zBVXzkgXrNAUQnMWvq6lSx+01FNfYP/+U167HhIE7i4=\"}},\"text\":\"Wage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and\\nCongress.

Most\\nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as\\nexpected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or\\neven bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California’s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii).\\nIn such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once\\nregarded as among the most stable industries in America.\\nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through\\na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior\\nperformance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely\\nbe required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that\\nutilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE’s\\nextensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some\\nyears from completion. Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the\\ncontinental United States.\\nWith this model employed by both private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on,\\neven if population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The “margin of safety”\\napproach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactory-\\nreturn pact has been broken in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such\\nruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground transmission may be\\nrequired but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay the staggering costs for such construction?\\n13\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3148,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"RvTcfNzUDqeD86qTZL7qxoC1BWChoTbV361/y2Uw0Xo=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"fd2abe16-ebd7-42ae-b04e-dce0f8ece15d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"fd2abe16-ebd7-42ae-b04e-dce0f8ece15d\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"mu7RmsFnz9Ah40p1OKQl4pjdCui0xQAAdyHFkGybfIc=\"}},\"text\":\"At Berkshire, we have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred.\\nThese costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have increased – and will likely\\ncontinue to increase – if convective storms become more frequent.\\nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s forest-fire losses and can\\nintelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western\\nstates. It remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere.\\nOther electric utilities may face survival problems resembling those of Pacific Gas and\\nElectric and Hawaiian Electric. A confiscatory resolution of our present problems would obviously\\nbe a negative for BHE, but both that company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive\\nnegative surprises. We regularly get these in our insurance business, where our basic product is\\nrisk assumption, and they will occur elsewhere. Berkshire can sustain financial surprises but we\\nwill not knowingly throw good money after bad.\\nWhatever the case at Berkshire, the final result for the utility industry may be ominous:\\nCertain utilities might no longer attract the savings of American citizens and will be forced to\\nadopt the public-power model. Nebraska made this choice in the 1930s and there are many\\npublic-power operations throughout the country. Eventually, voters, taxpayers and users will\\ndecide which model they prefer.\\nWhen the dust settles, America’s power needs and the consequent capital expenditure will\\nbe staggering. I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns\\nand, along with Berkshire’s two partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nEnough about problems: Our insurance business performed exceptionally well last year,\\nsetting records in sales, float and underwriting profits. Property-casualty insurance (“P/C”)\\nprovides the core of Berkshire’s well-being and growth. We have been in the business for 57 years\\nand despite our nearly 5,000-fold increase in volume – from $17 million to $83 billion – we have\\nmuch room to grow.\\nBeyond that, we have learned – too often, painfully – a good deal about what types of\\ninsurance business and what sort of people to avoid. The most important lesson is that our\\nunderwriters can be thin, fat, male, female, young, old, foreign or domestic. But they can’t be\\noptimists at the office, however desirable that quality may generally be in life.\\nSurprises in the P/C business – which can occur decades after six-month or one-year\\npolicies have expired – are almost always negative. The industry’s accounting is designed to\\nrecognize this reality, but estimation mistakes can be huge. And when charlatans are involved,\\ndetection is often both slow and costly. Berkshire will always attempt to be accurate in its estimates\\nof future loss payments but inflation – both monetary and the “legal” variety – is a wild card.\\n14\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2972,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"aX1x8VEmUQnIz+za6sH6umCzUYO0MMoN6VcC/RAr9jY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c20541ea-532a-48e0-bece-183faf6c46ef":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c20541ea-532a-48e0-bece-183faf6c46ef\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_14\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"xWKEmaCWkK3pz4bOsUDpKL8v6/DCgWic6c+IbceOlVo=\"}},\"text\":\"I’ve told the story of our insurance operations so many times that I will simply direct\\nnewcomers to page 18. Here, I will only repeat that our position would not be what it is if Ajit Jain\\nhad not joined Berkshire in 1986. Before that lucky day – aside from an almost unbelievably\\nwonderful experience with GEICO that began early in 1951 and will never end – I was largely\\nwandering in the wilderness, as I struggled to build our insurance operation.\\nAjit’s achievements since joining Berkshire have been supported by a large cast of\\nhugely-talented insurance executives in our various P/C operations. Their names and faces are\\nunknown to most of the press and the public. Berkshire’s lineup of managers, however, is to P/C\\ninsurance what Cooperstown’s honorees are to baseball.\\nBertie, you can feel good about the fact that you own a piece of an incredible P/C operation\\nthat now operates worldwide with unmatched financial resources, reputation and talent. It carried\\nthe day in 2023.\\nWhat is it with Omaha?\\nCome to Berkshire’s annual gathering on May 4, 2024. On stage you will see the three\\nmanagers who now bear the prime responsibilities for steering your company. What, you may\\nwonder, do the three have in common? They certainly don’t look alike. Let’s dig deeper.\\nGreg Abel, who runs all non-insurance operations for Berkshire – and in all respects is\\nready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow – was born and raised in Canada (he still plays hockey).\\nIn the 1990s, however, Greg lived for six years in Omaha just a few blocks away from me. During\\nthat period, I never met him.\\nA decade or so earlier, Ajit Jain, who was born, raised and educated in India, lived with his\\nfamily in Omaha only a mile or so from my home (where I’ve lived since 1958). Both Ajit and his\\nwife, Tinku, have many Omaha friends, though it’s been more than three decades since they moved\\nto New York (in order to be where much of the action in reinsurance takes place).\\nMissing from the stage this year will be Charlie. He and I were both born in Omaha about\\ntwo miles from where you will sit at our May get-together. In his first ten years, Charlie lived\\nabout a half-mile from where Berkshire has long maintained its office. Both Charlie and I spent\\nour early years in Omaha public schools and were indelibly shaped by our Omaha childhood. We\\ndidn’t meet, however, until much later. (A footnote that may surprise you: Charlie lived under 15\\nof America’s 45 presidents. People refer to President Biden as #46, but that numbering counts\\nGrover Cleveland as both #22 and #24 because his terms were not consecutive. America is a very\\nyoung country.)\\n15\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2631,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"zZlFFG0PoRZ0THjlZHMHL1q092xvP+PMGtg0ElSiFkg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"160c6935-dd19-407b-845c-0a1f4f70b189":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"160c6935-dd19-407b-845c-0a1f4f70b189\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864292090-berkshire.pdf_15\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864292090-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"B+UC/olg39VrDcBNHgmAQxJmzqrxyp3Hex7JdpmTezQ=\"}},\"text\":\"Moving to the corporate level, Berkshire itself relocated in 1970 from its 81 years of\\nresidence in New England to settle in Omaha, leaving its troubles behind and blossoming in its\\nnew home.\\nAs a final punctuation point to the “Omaha Effect,” Bertie – yes that Bertie – spent her\\nearly formative years in a middle-class neighborhood in Omaha and, many decades later, emerged\\nas one of the country’s great investors.\\nYou may be thinking that she put all of her money in Berkshire and then simply sat on it.\\nBut that’s not true. After starting a family in 1956, Bertie was active financially for 20 years:\\nholding bonds, putting 1⁄3 of her funds in a publicly-held mutual fund and trading stocks with some\\nfrequency. Her potential remained unnoticed.\\nThen, in 1980, when 46, and independent of any urgings from her brother, Bertie decided\\nto make her move. Retaining only the mutual fund and Berkshire, she made no new trades during\\nthe next 43 years. During that period, she became very rich, even after making large philanthropic\\ngifts (think nine figures).\\nMillions of American investors could have followed her reasoning which involved only\\nthe common sense she had somehow absorbed as a child in Omaha.

Its introduction to Europe began in 1782 when a French\\nJesuit Father living in China, Joseph Amiot, acquired a copy of it, and translated it into\\nFrench. It was not a good translation because, according to Dr. Giles, \\\"[I]t contains a\\ngreat deal that Sun Tzu did not write, and very little indeed of what he did.\\\"\\nThe first translation into English was published in 1905 in Tokyo by Capt. E. F.\\nCalthrop, R.F.A. However, this translation is, in the words of Dr. Giles, \\\"excessively\\nbad.\\\" He goes further in this criticism: \\\"It is not merely a question of downright blun-\\nders, from which none can hope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent; hard\\npassages were willfully distorted or slurred over. Such offenses are less pardonable.\\nThey would not be tolerated in any edition of a Latin or Greek classic, and a similar\\nstandard of honesty ought to be insisted upon in translations from Chinese.\\\" In 1908\\na new edition of Capt. Calthrop’s translation was published in London. It was an im-\\nprovement on the first – omissions filled up and numerous mistakes corrected – but\\nnew errors were created in the process. Dr. Giles, in justifying his translation, wrote:\\n\\\"It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate of my own powers; but I could not\\nhelp feeling that Sun Tzu deserved a better fate than had befallen him, and I knew that,\\nat any rate, I could hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors.\\\"\\nClearly, Dr. Giles’ work established much of the groundwork for the work of later\\ntranslators who published their own editions. Of the later editions of the ART OF WAR\\nI have examined; two feature Giles’ edited translation and notes, the other two present\\nthe same basic information from the ancient Chinese commentators found in the Giles\\nedition. Of these four, Giles’ 1910 edition is the most scholarly and presents the reader\\nan incredible amount of information concerning Sun Tzu’s text, much more than any\\nother translation.\\nThe Giles’ edition of the ART OF WAR, as stated above, was a scholarly work.\\nDr. Giles was a leading sinologue at the time and an assistant in the Department of\\nOriental Printed Books and Manuscripts in the British Museum. Apparently he wanted\\nto produce a definitive edition, superior to anything else that existed and perhaps some-\\nthing that would become a standard translation. It was the best translation available for\\n50 years. But apparently there was not much interest in Sun Tzu in English- speaking\\ncountries since it took the start of the Second World War to renew interest in his work.\\nSeveral people published unsatisfactory English translations of Sun Tzu. In 1944, Dr.\\nGiles’ translation was edited and published in the United States in a series of military\\nscience books. But it wasn’t until 1963 that a good English translation (by Samuel B.\\nGriffith and still in print) was published that was an equal to Giles’ translation. While\\nthis translation is more lucid than Dr. Giles’ translation, it lacks his copious notes that\\nmake his so interesting.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3368,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"HxjtMeWkeRaVUV6+fL+J9i5Qo4aoaICJWVkz+65AwmA=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"8d1d6311-5498-465f-b636-4bf910f010bb":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"8d1d6311-5498-465f-b636-4bf910f010bb\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"CuCyFAgqy0MiC12tTvSHyRl+cG3yun7bf3NrXWFuOZs=\"}},\"text\":\"CONTENTS 4\\nDr. Giles produced a work primarily intended for scholars of the Chinese civiliza-\\ntion and language. It contains the Chinese text of Sun Tzu, the English translation, and\\nvoluminous notes along with numerous footnotes. Unfortunately, some of his notes and\\nfootnotes contain Chinese characters; some are completely Chinese. Thus, a conver-\\nsion to a Latin alphabet etext was difficult. I did the conversion in complete ignorance\\nof Chinese (except for what I learned while doing the conversion). Thus, I faced the\\ndifficult task of paraphrasing it while retaining as much of the important text as I could.\\nEvery paraphrase represents a loss; thus I did what I could to retain as much of the text\\nas possible. Because the 1910 text contains a Chinese concordance, I was able to trans-\\nliterate proper names, books, and the like at the risk of making the text more obscure.\\nHowever, the text, on the whole, is quite satisfactory for the casual reader, a transform-\\nation made possible by conversion to an etext. However, I come away from this task\\nwith the feeling of loss because I know that someone with a background in Chinese\\ncan do a better job than I did; any such attempt would be welcomed.\\nBob Sutton\\nal876@cleveland.freenet.edu\\nbobs@gnu.ai.mit.edu\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":1265,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"o6xbn35P4Wx0LlCr+3IXVZjDnmCRBiiAUSmIF0Jtkd0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5577c603-c3b0-4a35-ba67-38d2190286db":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5577c603-c3b0-4a35-ba67-38d2190286db\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":6,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_6\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":6,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"1c9cerGmaW9yPm1yM/R6OLS8rStwt+o2BL9G7sv0UAM=\"}},\"text\":\"Chapter 1\\nINTRODUCTION\\n1.1 Sun Wu and his Book\\nSsu-ma Ch‘ien gives the following biography of Sun Tzu:1\\nSun Tzu Wu was a native of the Ch‘i State.

Sun Tzu: \\\"If\\nwords of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly\\nunderstood, the general is to blame. But if his orders ARE clear, and the\\nsoldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers.\\\"\\nSo saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be beheaded.\\nNow the king of Wu was watching the scene from the top of a raised\\npavilion; and when he saw that his favorite concubines were about to be\\nexecuted, he was greatly alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following\\nmessage: \\\"We are now quite satisfied as to our general’s ability to handle\\ntroops. If We are bereft of these two concubines, our meat and drink will\\nlose their savor. It is our wish that they shall not be beheaded.\\\"\\nSun Tzu replied: \\\"Having once received His Majesty’s commission to\\nbe the general of his forces, there are certain commands of His Majesty\\nwhich, acting in that capacity, I am unable to accept.\\\"\\nAccordingly, he had the two leaders beheaded, and straightway installed\\nthe pair next in order as leaders in their place. When this had been done,\\nthe drum was sounded for the drill once more; and the girls went through\\nall the evolutions, turning to the right or to the left, marching ahead or\\nwheeling back, kneeling or standing, with perfect accuracy and precision,\\nnot venturing to utter a sound. Then Sun Tzu sent a messenger to the King\\nsaying: \\\"Your soldiers, Sire, are now properly drilled and disciplined, and\\nready for your majesty’s inspection. They can be put to any use that their\\nsovereign may desire; bid them go through fire and water, and they will\\nnot disobey.\\\"\\nBut the King replied: \\\"Let our general cease drilling and return to camp.\\nAs for us, We have no wish to come down and inspect the troops.\\\"\\nThereupon Sun Tzu said: \\\"The King is only fond of words, and cannot\\ntranslate them into deeds.\\\"\\nAfter that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tzu was one who knew how to handle an\\narmy, and finally appointed him general. In the west, he defeated the Ch‘u\\nState and forced his way into Ying, the capital; to the north he put fear\\ninto the States of Ch‘i and Chin, and spread his fame abroad amongst the\\nfeudal princes. And Sun Tzu shared in the might of the King.\\nAbout Sun Tzu himself this is all that Ssu-ma Ch‘ien has to tell us in this chapter. But\\nhe proceeds to give a biography of his descendant, Sun Pin, born about a hundred years\\nafter his famous ancestor’s death, and also the outstanding military genius of his time.\\nThe historian speaks of him too as Sun Tzu, and in his preface we read: \\\"Sun Tzu\\nhad his feet cut off and yet continued to discuss the art of war.\\\"3 It seems likely, then,\\nthat \\\"Pin\\\" was a nickname bestowed on him after his mutilation, unless the story was\\ninvented in order to account for the name.

INTRODUCTION 7\\ncrushing defeat of his treacherous rival P‘ang Chuan, will be found briefly related in\\nChapter V. ss. 19, note.\\nTo return to the elder Sun Tzu. He is mentioned in two other passages of the SHIH\\nCHI:\\nIn the third year of his reign [512 B.C.] Ho Lu, king of Wu, took the\\nfield with Tzu-hsu [i.e. Wu Yuan] and Po P‘ei, and attacked Ch‘u. He\\ncaptured the town of Shu and slew the two prince’s sons who had formerly\\nbeen generals of Wu. He was then meditating a descent on Ying [the\\ncapital]; but the general Sun Wu said: \\\"The army is exhausted. It is not\\nyet possible. We must wait\\\".... [After further successful fighting,] \\\"in the\\nninth year [506 B.C.], King Ho Lu addressed Wu Tzu-hsu and Sun Wu,\\nsaying: \\\"Formerly, you declared that it was not yet possible for us to enter\\nYing. Is the time ripe now?\\\" The two men replied: \\\"Ch‘u’s general Tzu-\\nch‘ang, 4 is grasping and covetous, and the princes of T‘ang and Ts‘ai both\\nhave a grudge against him. If Your Majesty has resolved to make a grand\\nattack, you must win over T‘ang and Ts‘ai, and then you may succeed.\\\"\\nHo Lu followed this advice, [beat Ch‘u in five pitched battles and marched\\ninto Ying.]5\\nThis is the latest date at which anything is recorded of Sun Wu. He does not appear to\\nhave survived his patron, who died from the effects of a wound in 496.\\nIn another chapter there occurs this passage:6\\nFrom this time onward, a number of famous soldiers arose, one after the\\nother: Kao-fan,7 who was employed by the Chin State; Wang-tzu,8 in the\\nservice of Ch‘i; and Sun Wu, in the service of Wu. These men developed\\nand threw light upon the principles of war.\\nIt is obvious enough that Ssu-ma Ch‘ien at least had no doubt about the reality of Sun\\nWu as an historical personage; and with one exception, to be noticed presently, he is\\nby far the most important authority on the period in question. It will not be necessary,\\ntherefore, to say much of such a work as the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU, which is\\nsupposed to have been written by Chao Yeh of the 1st century A.D. The attribution is\\nsomewhat doubtful; but even if it were otherwise, his account would be of little value,\\nbased as it is on the SHIH CHI and expanded with romantic details. The story of Sun\\nTzu will be found, for what it is worth, in chapter 2. The only new points in it worth\\nnoting are: (1) Sun Tzu was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu Tzu-hsu. (2) He is\\ncalled a native of Wu. (3) He had previously lived a retired life, and his contemporaries\\nwere unaware of his ability.\\nThe following passage occurs in the Huai-nan Tzu: \\\"When sovereign and ministers\\nshow perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tzu to encounter the foe.\\\"\\n4The appellation of Nang Wa.\\n5SHI CHI, ch. 31.\\n6SHI CHI, ch. 25.\\n7The appellation of Hu Yen, mentioned in ch. 39 under the year 637.\\n8Wang-tzu Ch‘eng-fu, ch. 32, year 607.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2853,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"GuiP9LvYG8Kfs58c4l/gjpvR5GfFRULUDLruvB2b2M8=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4cd91f6d-6264-48d0-88db-0ee5e0948e7e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4cd91f6d-6264-48d0-88db-0ee5e0948e7e\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"21LSzLE69K/XiaKoIr5SFxyGY8i9M7AkN6wV/ANLl7c=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

He had three sons, of whom the second, named Ming, was the father of Sun\\nPin. According to this account then, Pin was the grandson of Wu, which, considering\\nthat Sun Pin’s victory over Wei was gained in 341 B.C., may be dismissed as chronolo-\\ngical impossible. Whence these data were obtained by Teng Ming-shih I do not know,\\nbut of course no reliance whatever can be placed in them.\\nAn interesting document which has survived from the close of the Han period is\\nthe short preface written by the Great Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, or Wei Wu Ti, for his edition of Sun\\nTzu.

INTRODUCTION 9\\ntime, Sun Pin lived. He was a descendant of Wu.] 12 In his treatment of\\ndeliberation and planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the field, 13\\nclearness of conception, and depth of design, Sun Tzu stands beyond the\\nreach of carping criticism. My contemporaries, however, have failed to\\ngrasp the full meaning of his instructions, and while putting into practice\\nthe smaller details in which his work abounds, they have overlooked its\\nessential purport. That is the motive which has led me to outline a rough\\nexplanation of the whole.\\nOne thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit statement that the 13 chapters were\\nspecially composed for King Ho Lu. This is supported by the internal evidence of I. ss.\\n15, in which it seems clear that some ruler is addressed.\\nIn the bibliographic section of the HAN SHU, there is an entry which has given\\nrise to much discussion: \\\"The works of Sun Tzu of Wu in 82 P‘IEN (or chapters), with\\ndiagrams in 9 CHUAN.\\\" It is evident that this cannot be merely the 13 chapters known\\nto Ssu-ma Ch‘ien, or those we possess today. Chang Shou-chieh refers to an edition\\nof Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR of which the \\\"13 chapters\\\" formed the first CHUAN,\\nadding that there were two other CHUAN besides. This has brought forth a theory, that\\nthe bulk of these 82 chapters consisted of other writings of Sun Tzu – we should call\\nthem apocryphal – similar to the WEN TA, of which a specimen dealing with the Nine\\nSituations14 is preserved in the T‘UNG TIEN, and another in Ho Shin’s commentary.\\nIt is suggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzu had only written the\\n13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of question and\\nanswer between himself and the King. Pi I-hsun, the author of the SUN TZU HSU\\nLU, backs this up with a quotation from the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU: \\\"The King of\\nWu summoned Sun Tzu, and asked him questions about the art of war. Each time he\\nset forth a chapter of his work, the King could not find words enough to praise him.\\\"\\nAs he points out, if the whole work was expounded on the same scale as in the above-\\nmentioned fragments, the total number of chapters could not fail to be considerable.\\nThen the numerous other treatises attributed to Sun Tzu might be included. The fact\\nthat the HAN CHIH mentions no work of Sun Tzu except the 82 P‘IEN, whereas the\\nSui and T‘ang bibliographies give the titles of others in addition to the \\\"13 chapters,\\\" is\\ngood proof, Pi I-hsun thinks, that all of these were contained in the 82 P‘IEN.

This, as Sun Hsing-yen points\\nout, is only a modest way of saying that he made an explanatory paraphrase, or in other\\nwords, wrote a commentary on it. On the whole, this theory has met with very little\\nacceptance. Thus, the SSU K‘U CH‘UAN SHU says: \\\"The mention of the 13 chapters\\nin the SHIH CHI shows that they were in existence before the HAN CHIH, and that\\nlatter accretions are not to be considered part of the original work. Tu Mu’s assertion\\ncan certainly not be taken as proof.\\\"\\nThere is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters existed in the time of\\nSsu-ma Ch‘ien practically as we have them now. That the work was then well known\\nhe tells us in so many words. \\\"Sun Tzu’s 13 Chapters and Wu Ch‘i’s Art of War are the\\ntwo books that people commonly refer to on the subject of military matters. Both of\\nthem are widely distributed, so I will not discuss them here.\\\" But as we go further back,\\nserious difficulties begin to arise. The salient fact which has to be faced is that the TSO\\nCHUAN, the greatest contemporary record, makes no mention whatsoever of Sun Wu,\\neither as a general or as a writer. It is natural, in view of this awkward circumstance,\\nthat many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story of Sun Wu as given in the\\nSHIH CHI, but even show themselves frankly skeptical as to the existence of the man\\nat all. The most powerful presentment of this side of the case is to be found in the\\nfollowing disposition by Yeh Shui-hsin:16\\nIt is stated in Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s history that Sun Wu was a native of the Ch‘i\\nState, and employed by Wu; and that in the reign of Ho Lu he crushed\\nCh‘u, entered Ying, and was a great general. But in Tso’s Commentary no\\nSun Wu appears at all. It is true that Tso’s Commentary need not contain\\nabsolutely everything that other histories contain. But Tso has not omitted\\nto mention vulgar plebeians and hireling ruffians such as Ying K‘ao-shu,17\\nTs‘ao Kuei,18, Chu Chih-wu and Chuan She-chu19. In the case of Sun\\nWu, whose fame and achievements were so brilliant, the omission is much\\nmore glaring. Again, details are given, in their due order, about his con-\\ntemporaries Wu Yuan and the Minister P‘ei.20 Is it credible that Sun Wu\\nalone should have been passed over?\\nIn point of literary style, Sun Tzu’s work belongs to the same school as\\nKUAN TZU,21 LIU T‘AO,22 and the YUEH YU23 and may have been the\\nproduction of some private scholar living towards the end of the \\\"Spring\\nthe case of very short works, one is tempted to think that P‘IEN might simply mean \\\"leaves.\\\"\\n16Yeh Shih of the Sung dynasty [1151-1223].\\n17He hardly deserves to be bracketed with assassins.\\n18See Chapter 7, ss. 27 and Chapter 11, ss. 28.\\n19See Chapter 11, ss. 28.

most\\nshameless offenders in this respect are Wu Ch‘i and Huai-nan Tzu, both of them im-\\nportant historical personages in their day.The former lived only a century after the\\nalleged date of Sun Tzu, and his death is known to have taken place in 381 B.C.It was\\nto him, according to Liu Hsiang, that Tseng Shen delivered the TSO CHUAN, which\\nhad been entrusted to him by its author.28 Now the fact that quotations from the ART\\nOF WAR, acknowledged or otherwise, are to be found in so many authors of differ-\\nent epochs, establishes a very strong anterior to them all, – in other words, that Sun\\nTzu’s treatise was already in existence towards the end of the 5th century B.C.Further\\nproof of Sun Tzu’s antiquity is furnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings\\nattaching to a number of the words he uses.A list of these, which might perhaps be\\nextended, is given in the HSU LU; and though some of the interpretations are doubtful,\\nthe main argument is hardly affected thereby.Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh\\nShui- hsin, a scholar and critic of the first rank, deliberately pronounces the style of the\\n13 chapters to belong to the early part of the fifth century.Seeing that he is actually\\nengaged in an attempt to disprove the existence of Sun Wu himself, we may be sure that\\nhe would not have hesitated to assign the work to a later date had he not honestly be-\\nlieved the contrary.And it is precisely on such a point that the judgment of an educated\\nChinaman will carry most weight.Other internal evidence is not far to seek.Thus in\\nXIII.ss.1, there is an unmistakable allusion to the ancient system of land-tenure which\\nhad already passed away by the time of Mencius, who was anxious to see it revived in\\na modified form.29 The only warfare Sun Tzu knows is that carried on between the\\nvarious feudal princes, in which armored chariots play a large part.Their use seems to\\nhave entirely died out before the end of the Chou dynasty.He speaks as a man of Wu,\\na state which ceased to exist as early as 473 B.C.On this I shall touch presently.But once refer the work to the 5th century or earlier, and the chances of its being\\nother than a bona fide production are sensibly diminished.The great age of forgeries\\ndid not come until long after.That it should have been forged in the period immedi-\\nately following 473 is particularly unlikely, for no one, as a rule, hastens to identify\\nhimself with a lost cause.As for Yeh Shui-hsin’s theory, that the author was a literary\\nrecluse, that seems to me quite untenable.If one thing is more apparent than another\\nafter reading the maxims of Sun Tzu, it is that their essence has been distilled from\\na large store of personal observation and experience.They reflect the mind not only\\nof a born strategist, gifted with a rare faculty of generalization, but also of a practical\\nsoldier closely acquainted with the military conditions of his time.To say nothing of\\nthe fact that these sayings have been accepted and endorsed by all the greatest captains\\nof Chinese history, they offer a combination of freshness and sincerity, acuteness and\\ncommon sense, which quite excludes the idea that they were artificially concocted in\\nthe study.If we admit, then, that the 13 chapters were the genuine production of a\\nmilitary man living towards the end of the \\\"CH‘UN CH‘IU\\\" period, are we not bound,\\nin spite of the silence of the TSO CHUAN, to accept Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s account in its\\nentirety?In view of his high repute as a sober historian,

There is still one grave, if not fatal, objec-\\ntion to the chronology involved in the story as told in the SHIH CHI, which, so far as I\\nam aware, nobody has yet pointed out. There are two passages in Sun Tzu in which he\\nalludes to contemporary affairs. The first in in VI. ss. 21:\\nThough according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in\\nnumber, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say\\nthen that victory can be achieved.\\nThe other is in XI. ss. 30:\\nAsked if an army can be made to imitate the SHUAI-JAN, I should answer,\\nYes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are\\ncrossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come\\nto each other’s assistance just as the left hand helps the right.\\nThese two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of composition.\\nThey assign the work to the period of the struggle between Wu and Yueh. So much\\nhas been observed by Pi I-hsun. But what has hitherto escaped notice is that they also\\nseriously impair the credibility of Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s narrative. As we have seen above,\\nthe first positive date given in connection with Sun Wu is 512 B.C. He is then spoken\\nof as a general, acting as confidential adviser to Ho Lu, so that his alleged introduction\\nto that monarch had already taken place, and of course the 13 chapters must have been\\nwritten earlier still. But at that time, and for several years after, down to the capture\\nof Ying in 506, Ch‘u and not Yueh, was the great hereditary enemy of Wu. The two\\nstates, Ch‘u and Wu, had been constantly at war for over half a century, 30 whereas the\\nfirst war between Wu and Yueh was waged only in 510, 31 and even then was no more\\nthan a short interlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with Ch‘u. Now\\nCh‘u is not mentioned in the 13 chapters at all. The natural inference is that they were\\nwritten at a time when Yueh had become the prime antagonist of Wu, that is, after Ch‘u\\nhad suffered the great humiliation of 506. At this point, a table of dates may be found\\nuseful.\\n30When Wu first appears in the CH‘UN CH‘IU in 584, it is already at variance with its powerful neighbor.\\nThe CH‘UN CH‘IU first mentions Yueh in 537, the TSO CHUAN in 601.\\n31This is explicitly stated in the TSO CHUAN, XXXII, 2.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2454,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"/AHi4uVmBsmZKCf88BNNduJKIh5L57Y1QvWCaVf5gBs=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c2d4ea0e-2877-47bd-beca-7b0356d0ce3a":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c2d4ea0e-2877-47bd-beca-7b0356d0ce3a\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_15\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"dMiiNgBvAV+6QNBy48DAQFzVlxoQoBfyFHECNneFzv8=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

It seems rather to imply that, for the moment at\\nleast, the tide had turned against Wu, and that she was getting the worst of the struggle.\\nHence we may conclude that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which\\ndate Yueh does not appear to have scored any notable success against Wu. Ho Lu died\\nin 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must have been during the period\\n505-496, when there was a lull in the hostilities, Wu having presumably exhausted\\nby its supreme effort against Ch‘u. On the other hand, if we choose to disregard the\\ntradition connecting Sun Wu’s name with Ho Lu, it might equally well have seen the\\nlight between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period 482-473, when Yueh was once\\nagain becoming a very serious menace.32 We may feel fairly certain that the author,\\nwhoever he may have been, was not a man of any great eminence in his own day.\\nOn this point the negative testimony of the TSO CHUAN far outweighs any shred of\\nauthority still attaching to the SHIH CHI, if once its other facts are discredited. Sun\\nHsing-yen, however, makes a feeble attempt to explain the omission of his name from\\nthe great commentary. It was Wu Tzu-hsu, he says, who got all the credit of Sun Wu’s\\nexploits, because the latter (being an alien) was not rewarded with an office in the State.\\nHow then did the Sun Tzu legend originate? It may be that the growing celebrity\\nof the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown to its author.

With this necessary proviso, I should say that he\\nprobably entered the service of Wu about the time of Ho Lu’s accession, and gathered\\nexperience, though only in the capacity of a subordinate officer, during the intense mil-\\nitary activity which marked the first half of the prince’s reign.34 If he rose to be a gen-\\neral at all, he certainly was never on an equal footing with the three above mentioned.\\nHe was doubtless present at the investment and occupation of Ying, and witnessed Wu’s\\nsudden collapse in the following year. Yueh’s attack at this critical juncture, when her\\nrival was embarrassed on every side, seems to have convinced him that this upstart\\nkingdom was the great enemy against whom every effort would henceforth have to be\\ndirected. Sun Wu was thus a well-seasoned warrior when he sat down to write his\\nfamous book, which according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the end,\\nrather than the beginning of Ho Lu’s reign. The story of the women may possibly have\\ngrown out of some real incident occurring about the same time. As we hear no more\\nof Sun Wu after this from any source, he is hardly likely to have survived his patron\\nor to have taken part in the death-struggle with Yueh, which began with the disaster at\\nTsuili.\\nIf these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain irony in the fate\\nwhich decreed that China’s most illustrious man of peace should be contemporary with\\nher greatest writer on war.\\n1.2 The Text of Sun Tzu\\nI have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzu’s text. The quo-\\ntations that occur in early authors go to show that the \\\"13 chapters\\\" of which Ssu-ma\\nCh‘ien speaks were essentially the same as those now extant. We have his word for it\\nthat they were widely circulated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from\\ndiscussing them on that account. Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface:\\nDuring the Ch‘in and Han dynasties Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR was in\\ngeneral use amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated\\nit as a work of mysterious import, and were unwilling to expound it for the\\nbenefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was the first to write\\na commentary on it.\\nAs we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that Ts‘ao Kung\\ntampered with the text. But the text itself is often so obscure, and the number of edi-\\ntions which appeared from that time onward so great, especially during the T‘ang and\\nSung dynasties, that it would be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed\\n33With Wu Yuan himself the case is just the reverse: – a spurious treatise on war has been fathered on him\\nsimply because he was a great general.

Towards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the chief com-\\nmentaries on Sun Tzu were in existence, a certain Chi T‘ien-pao published a work in\\n15 CHUAN entitled \\\"Sun Tzu with the collected commentaries of ten writers.\\\" There\\nwas another text, with variant readings put forward by Chu Fu of Ta-hsing, which also\\nhad supporters among the scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun Hsing-\\nyen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no longer put into circula-\\ntion. Thus, until the end of the 18th century, the text in sole possession of the field\\nwas one derived from Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition, although no actual copy of that import-\\nant work was known to have survived. That, therefore, is the text of Sun Tzu which\\nappears in the War section of the great Imperial encyclopedia printed in 1726, the KU\\nCHIN T‘U SHU CHI CH‘ENG. Another copy at my disposal of what is practically\\nthe same text, with slight variations, is that contained in the \\\"Eleven philosophers of\\nthe Chou and Ch‘in dynasties\\\" [1758]. And the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop’s\\nfirst edition is evidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese channels.\\nSo things remained until Sun Hsing-yen [1752-1818], a distinguished antiquarian and\\nclassical scholar, who claimed to be an actual descendant of Sun Wu,35 accidentally\\ndiscovered a copy of Chi T‘ien-pao’s long-lost work, when on a visit to the library\\nof the Hua-yin temple.36 Appended to it was the I SHUO of Cheng Yu-Hsien, men-\\ntioned in the T‘UNG CHIH, and also believed to have perished. This is what Sun\\nHsing-yen designates as the \\\"original edition (or text)\\\" – a rather misleading name, for\\nit cannot by any means claim to set before us the text of Sun Tzu in its pristine purity.\\nChi T‘ien-pao was a careless compiler, and appears to have been content to reproduce\\nthe somewhat debased version current in his day, without troubling to collate it with\\nthe earliest editions then available. Fortunately, two versions of Sun Tzu, even older\\nthan the newly discovered work, were still extant, one buried in the T‘UNG TIEN, Tu\\nYu’s great treatise on the Constitution, the other similarly enshrined in the T‘AI P‘ING\\nYU LAN encyclopedia. In both the complete text is to be found, though split up into\\nfragments, intermixed with other matter, and scattered piecemeal over a number of dif-\\nferent sections. Considering that the YU LAN takes us back to the year 983, and the\\nT‘UNG TIEN about 200 years further still, to the middle of the T‘ang dynasty, the\\nvalue of these early transcripts of Sun Tzu can hardly be overestimated. Yet the idea of\\nutilizing them does not seem to have occurred to anyone until Sun Hsing-yen, acting\\nunder Government instructions, undertook a thorough recension of the text. This is his\\nown account:\\nBecause of the numerous mistakes in the text of Sun Tzu which his editors\\nhad handed down, the Government ordered that the ancient edition [of\\nChi T‘ien-pao] should be used, and that the text should be revised and\\ncorrected throughout. It happened that Wu Nien-hu, the Governor Pi Kua,\\nand Hsi, a graduate of the second degree, had all devoted themselves to\\n35Preface ad fin: \\\"My family comes from Lo-an, and we are really descended from Sun Tzu.

The commentary which has come down to us under this name\\nis comparatively meager, and nothing about the author is known. Even his per-\\nsonal name has not been recorded. Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition places him after Chia\\nLin,and Ch‘ao Kung- wu also assigns him to the T‘ang dynasty,40 but this is a\\nmistake. In Sun Hsing-yen’s preface, he appears as Meng Shih of the Liang dyn-\\nasty [502-557].

The T‘UNG CHIH\\nmentions \\\"Lives of famous generals from the Chou to the T‘ang dynasty\\\" as\\nwritten by him.41 According to Ch‘ao Kung-wu and the T‘IEN-I-KO catalogue,\\nhe followed a variant of the text of Sun Tzu which differs considerably from\\nthose now extant. His notes are mostly short and to the point, and he frequently\\nillustrates his remarks by anecdotes from Chinese history.\\n4. TU YU (died 812) did not publish a separate commentary on Sun Tzu, his notes\\nbeing taken from the T‘UNG TIEN, the encyclopedic treatise on the Constitution\\nwhich was his life- work. They are largely repetitions of Ts‘ao Kung and Meng\\nShih, besides which it is believed that he drew on the ancient commentaries of\\nWang Ling and others. Owing to the peculiar arrangement of T‘UNG TIEN, he\\nhas to explain each passage on its merits, apart from the context, and sometimes\\nhis own explanation does not agree with that of Ts‘ao Kung, whom he always\\nquotes first. Though not strictly to be reckoned as one of the \\\"Ten Commentat-\\nors,\\\" he was added to their number by Chi T‘ien-pao, being wrongly placed after\\nhis grandson Tu Mu.\\n5.

His commentary was published with\\na laudatory preface by the great Ou-yang Hsiu, from which we may cull the fol-\\nlowing:\\nLater scholars have misread Sun Tzu, distorting his words and trying to make\\nthem square with their own one-sided views. Thus, though commentators have\\nnot been lacking, only a few have proved equal to the task. My friend Sheng-yu\\nhas not fallen into this mistake. In attempting to provide a critical commentary\\nfor Sun Tzu’s work, he does not lose sight of the fact that these sayings were in-\\ntended for states engaged in internecine warfare; that the author is not concerned\\nwith the military conditions prevailing under the sovereigns of the three ancient\\ndynasties,42 nor with the nine punitive measures prescribed to the Minister of\\nWar.43 Again, Sun Wu loved brevity of diction, but his meaning is always deep.\\nWhether the subject be marching an army, or handling soldiers, or estimating the\\nenemy, or controlling the forces of victory, it is always systematically treated; the\\nsayings are bound together in strict logical sequence, though this has been ob-\\nscured by commentators who have probably failed to grasp their meaning.

The personal name of this commentator is\\ngiven as above by Cheng Ch‘iao in the TUNG CHIH, written about the middle\\nof the twelfth century, but he appears simply as Ho Shih in the YU HAI, and Ma\\nTuan-lin quotes Ch‘ao Kung-wu as saying that his personal name is unknown.\\nThere seems to be no reason to doubt Cheng Ch‘iao’s statement, otherwise I\\nshould have been inclined to hazard a guess and identify him with one Ho Ch‘u-\\nfei, the author of a short treatise on war, who lived in the latter part of the 11th\\ncentury. Ho Shih’s commentary, in the words of the T‘IEN-I-KO catalogue,\\n\\\"contains helpful additions\\\" here and there, but is chiefly remarkable for the\\ncopious extracts taken, in adapted form, from the dynastic histories and other\\nsources.\\n11. CHANG YU. The list closes with a commentator of no great originality perhaps,\\nbut gifted with admirable powers of lucid exposition. His commentator is based\\non that of Ts‘ao Kung, whose terse sentences he contrives to expand and develop\\nin masterly fashion. Without Chang Yu, it is safe to say that much of Ts‘ao\\nKung’s commentary would have remained cloaked in its pristine obscurity and\\ntherefore valueless.

Hence it is that the commentators of Sun\\nTzu in our dynasty belong mainly to that period.46\\nBesides these eleven commentators, there are several others whose work has not come\\ndown to us. The SUI SHU mentions four, namely Wang Ling (often quoted by Tu Yu\\nas Wang Tzu); Chang Tzu- shang; Chia Hsu of Wei;47 and Shen Yu of Wu. The T‘ANG\\nSHU adds Sun Hao, and the T‘UNG CHIH Hsiao Chi, while the T‘U SHU mentions\\na Ming commentator, Huang Jun-yu.

Among the famous generals who are known to have studied his pages with en-\\nthusiasm may be mentioned Han Hsin (d. 196 B.C.),48 Feng I (d. 34 A.D.),49 Lu Meng\\n(d. 219),50 and Yo Fei (1103-1141).51 The opinion of Ts‘ao Kung, who disputes with\\nHan Hsin the highest place in Chinese military annals, has already been recorded.52\\nStill more remarkable, in one way, is the testimony of purely literary men, such as Su\\nHsun (the father of Su Tung-p‘o), who wrote several essays on military topics, all of\\nwhich owe their chief inspiration to Sun Tzu. The following short passage by him is\\npreserved in the YU HAI:53\\nSun Wu’s saying, that in war one cannot make certain of conquering,54 is\\nvery different indeed from what other books tell us.55 Wu Ch‘i was a man\\nof the same stamp as Sun Wu: they both wrote books on war, and they\\nare linked together in popular speech as \\\"Sun and Wu.\\\" But Wu Ch‘i’s\\nremarks on war are less weighty, his rules are rougher and more crudely\\nstated, and there is not the same unity of plan as in Sun Tzu’s work, where\\nthe style is terse, but the meaning fully brought out.\\nThe following is an extract from the \\\"Impartial Judgments in the Garden of Literature\\\"\\nby Cheng Hou:\\n46T‘UNG K‘AO, loc. cit.\\n47A notable person in his day.

His sayings are terse yet elegant, simple yet profound, perspicuous\\nand eminently practical. Such works as the LUN YU, the I CHING and\\nthe great Commentary,56 as well as the writings of Mencius, Hsun K‘uang\\nand Yang Chu, all fall below the level of Sun Tzu.\\nChu Hsi, commenting on this, fully admits the first part of the criticism, although he\\ndislikes the audacious comparison with the venerated classical works. Language of\\nthis sort, he says, \\\"encourages a ruler’s bent towards unrelenting warfare and reckless\\nmilitarism.\\\"\\n1.5 Apologies for War\\nAccustomed as we are to think of China as the greatest peace-loving nation on earth,\\nwe are in some danger of forgetting that her experience of war in all its phases has\\nalso been such as no modern State can parallel. Her long military annals stretch back\\nto a point at which they are lost in the mists of time. She had built the Great Wall\\nand was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries before the first\\nRoman legionary was seen on the Danube. What with the perpetual collisions of the\\nancient feudal States, the grim conflicts with Huns, Turks and other invaders after the\\ncentralization of government, the terrific upheavals which accompanied the overthrow\\nof so many dynasties, besides the countless rebellions and minor disturbances that have\\nflamed up and flickered out again one by one, it is hardly too much to say that the clash\\nof arms has never ceased to resound in one portion or another of the Empire.\\nNo less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom China can\\npoint with pride. As in all countries, the greatest are fond of emerging at the most\\nfateful crises of her history. Thus, Po Ch‘i stands out conspicuous in the period when\\nCh‘in was entering upon her final struggle with the remaining independent states. The\\nstormy years which followed the break-up of the Ch‘in dynasty are illuminated by\\nthe transcendent genius of Han Hsin. When the House of Han in turn is tottering to\\nits fall, the great and baleful figure of Ts‘ao Ts‘ao dominates the scene. And in the\\nestablishment of the T‘ang dynasty,one of the mightiest tasks achieved by man, the\\nsuperhuman energy of Li Shih-min (afterwards the Emperor T‘ai Tsung) was seconded\\nby the brilliant strategy of Li Ching. None of these generals need fear comparison with\\nthe greatest names in the military history of Europe.\\nIn spite of all this, the great body of Chinese sentiment, from Lao Tzu downwards,\\nand especially as reflected in the standard literature of Confucianism, has been consist-\\nently pacific and intensely opposed to militarism in any form. It is such an uncommon\\nthing to find any of the literati defending warfare on principle, that I have thought it\\nworth while to collect and translate a few passages in which the unorthodox view is\\nupheld. The following, by Ssu-ma Ch‘ien, shows that for all his ardent admiration of\\nConfucius, he was yet no advocate of peace at any price:\\n56The TSO CHUAN.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3161,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"e/aUijNlRlULRLLLeu8Xrtt/sMH7pVOhe0RSoNabjAQ=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5acc7051-1efb-4b27-b7a4-2fd287d138cd":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5acc7051-1efb-4b27-b7a4-2fd287d138cd\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":24,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_24\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":24,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"OBvmwNC6/tMQre01LN/K3a3vNo9MPrhklNSwcmJ+s2A=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

The truth is that, just as in the\\nfamily the teacher must not spare the rod, and punishments cannot be dis-\\npensed with in the State, so military chastisement can never be allowed to\\nfall into abeyance in the Empire. All one can say is that this power will be\\nexercised wisely by some, foolishly by others, and that among those who\\nbear arms some will be loyal and others rebellious.57\\nThe next piece is taken from Tu Mu’s preface to his commentary on Sun Tzu:\\nWar may be defined as punishment, which is one of the functions of gov-\\nernment. It was the profession of Chung Yu and Jan Ch‘iu, both disciples\\nof Confucius. Nowadays, the holding of trials and hearing of litigation, the\\nimprisonment of offenders and their execution by flogging in the market-\\nplace, are all done by officials. But the wielding of huge armies, the throw-\\ning down of fortified cities, the hauling of women and children into cap-\\ntivity, and the beheading of traitors – this is also work which is done by\\nofficials. The objects of the rack and of military weapons are essentially\\nthe same. There is no intrinsic difference between the punishment of flog-\\nging and cutting off heads in war. For the lesser infractions of law, which\\nare easily dealt with, only a small amount of force need be employed:\\nhence the use of military weapons and wholesale decapitation. In both\\ncases, however, the end in view is to get rid of wicked people, and to give\\ncomfort and relief to the good....\\nChi-sun asked Jan Yu, saying: \\\"Have you, Sir, acquired your military\\naptitude by study, or is it innate?\\\" Jan Yu replied: \\\"It has been acquired\\nby study.\\\"58 \\\"How can that be so,\\\" said Chi-sun, \\\"seeing that you are a\\ndisciple of Confucius?\\\" \\\"It is a fact,\\\" replied Jan Yu; \\\"I was taught by\\nConfucius.

When Confucius held office under the Duke\\nof Lu, and a meeting was convened at Chia-ku,60 he said: \\\"If pacific ne-\\ngotiations are in progress, warlike preparations should have been made\\nbeforehand.\\\" He rebuked and shamed the Marquis of Ch‘i, who cowered\\nunder him and dared not proceed to violence. How can it be said that these\\ntwo great Sages had no knowledge of military matters?\\nWe have seen that the great Chu Hsi held Sun Tzu in high esteem. He also appeals to\\nthe authority of the Classics:\\nOur Master Confucius, answering Duke Ling of Wei, said: \\\"I have never\\nstudied matters connected with armies and battalions.\\\"61 Replying to K‘ung\\nWen-tzu, he said: I have not been instructed about buff-coats and weapons.\\\"\\nBut if we turn to the meeting at Chia-ku, we find that he used armed force\\nagainst the men of Lai, so that the marquis of Ch‘i was overawed.

He once uttered the\\nwords: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\"62 And Jan Yu also said: \\\"The Sage exercises\\nboth civil and military functions.\\\"63 Can it be a fact that Confucius never\\nstudied or received instruction in the art of war?

But if one can command\\nthe services of a good general like Sun Tzu, who was employed by Wu\\nTzu-hsu, there is no need to learn it oneself. Hence the remark added by\\nConfucius: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\"\\nThe men of the present day, however, willfully interpret these words of\\nConfucius in their narrowest sense, as though he meant that books on the\\nart of war were not worth reading. With blind persistency, they adduce the\\nexample of Chao Kua, who pored over his father’s books to no purpose,66\\nas a proof that all military theory is useless.

Chi got\\na rough idea of the art in its general bearings, but would not pursue his\\nstudies to their proper outcome, the consequence being that he was finally\\ndefeated and overthrown. He did not realize that the tricks and artifices\\nof war are beyond verbal computation. Duke Hsiang of Sung and King\\nYen of Hsu were brought to destruction by their misplaced humanity. The\\ntreacherous and underhand nature of war necessitates the use of guile and\\nstratagem suited to the occasion. There is a case on record of Confucius\\nhimself having violated an extorted oath,71 and also of his having left the\\nSung State in disguise.72 Can we then recklessly arraign Sun Tzu for dis-\\nregarding truth and honesty?\\n66See XIII. ss. 11, note.\\n67This is a rather obscure allusion to the TSO CHUAN, where Tzu-ch‘an says: \\\"If you have a piece of\\nbeautiful brocade, you will not employ a mere learner to make it up.\\\"\\n68Cf.

Ho\\nShih says: \\\"Haste may be stupid, but at any rate it saves expenditure of\\nenergy and treasure; protracted operations may be very clever, but they\\nbring calamity in their train.\\\" Wang Hsi evades the difficulty by remark-\\ning: \\\"Lengthy operations mean an army growing old, wealth being expen-\\nded, an empty exchequer and distress among the people; true cleverness\\ninsures against the occurrence of such calamities.\\\" Chang Yu says: \\\"So\\nlong as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable to clever dilat-\\noriness.\\\" Now Sun Tzu says nothing whatever, except possibly by implic-\\nation, about ill-considered haste being better than ingenious but lengthy\\noperations. What he does say is something much more guarded, namely\\nthat, while speed may sometimes be injudicious, tardiness can never be\\nanything but foolish – if only because it means impoverishment to the na-\\ntion. In considering the point raised here by Sun Tzu, the classic example\\nof Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur to the mind.

Wei Liao Tzu [4th cent. B.C.] says: ’Direct warfare\\nfavors frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.’ Ts‘ao Kung\\nsays: ’Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation; appearing on\\nthe enemy’s rear is an indirect maneuver.’ Li Wei-kung [6th and 7th cent.\\nA.D.] says: ’In war, to march straight ahead is CHENG; turning move-\\nments, on the other hand, are CH‘I.’ These writers simply regard CHENG\\nas CHENG, and CH‘I as CH‘I; they do not note that the two are mutually\\ninterchangeable and run into each other like the two sides of a circle [see\\ninfra, ss. 11]. A comment on the T‘ang Emperor T‘ai Tsung goes to the\\nroot of the matter: ’A CH‘I maneuver may be CHENG, if we make the\\nenemy look upon it as CHENG; then our real attack will be CH‘I, and vice\\nversa. The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot\\nfathom our real intent.’\\\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack\\nor other operation is CHENG, on which the enemy has had his attention\\nfixed; whereas that is CH‘I,\\\" which takes him by surprise or comes from\\nan unexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant\\nto be CH‘I,\\\" it immediately becomes CHENG.\\\"]\\n4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an\\negg - this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.\\n5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect\\nmethods will be needed in order to secure victory.\\n[Chang Yu says: \\\"Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding\\nthe enemy’s flanks or falling on his rear.\\\" A brilliant example of \\\"indirect\\ntactics\\\" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord Roberts’ night\\nmarch round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.1\\n6.

Of course, as has already been pointed out,\\nthe two are so inextricably interwoven in all military operations, that they\\ncannot really be considered apart.

In fact, all the\\nenemy’s movements should be determined by the signs that we choose to\\ngive him.\\\" Note the following anecdote of Sun Pin, a descendent of Sun\\nWu: In 341 B.C., the Ch‘i State being at war with Wei, sent T‘ien Chi and\\nSun Pin against the general P‘ang Chuan, who happened to be a deadly\\npersonal enemy of the later. Sun Pin said: \\\"The Ch‘i State has a reputation\\nfor cowardice, and therefore our adversary despises us. Let us turn this\\ncircumstance to account.\\\" Accordingly, when the army had crossed the\\nborder into Wei territory, he gave orders to show 100,000 fires on the first\\nnight, 50,000 on the next, and the night after only 20,000. P‘ang Chuan\\npursued them hotly, saying to himself: \\\"I knew these men of Ch‘i were\\ncowards: their numbers have already fallen away by more than half.\\\" In\\nhis retreat, Sun Pin came to a narrow defile, with he calculated that his\\npursuers would reach after dark. Here he had a tree stripped of its bark,\\nand inscribed upon it the words: \\\"Under this tree shall P‘ang Chuan die.\\\"\\nThen, as night began to fall, he placed a strong body of archers in ambush\\nnear by, with orders to shoot directly they saw a light. Later on, P‘ang\\nChuan arrived at the spot, and noticing the tree, struck a light in order to\\nread what was written on it. His body was immediately riddled by a volley\\nof arrows, and his whole army thrown into confusion. [The above is Tu\\nMu’s version of the story; the SHIH CHI, less dramatically but probably\\nwith more historical truth, makes P‘ang Chuan cut his own throat with an\\nexclamation of despair, after the rout of his army.] ]\\nHe sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.\\n20.

The King of\\nChao first consulted Lien P‘o on the advisability of attempting a relief,\\nbut the latter thought the distance too great, and the intervening country\\ntoo rugged and difficult.

Han Hsin now sent a party\\nto cut open the sandbags, thus releasing a great volume of water, which\\nswept down and prevented the greater portion of Lung Chu’s army from\\ngetting across.

In 227 A.D., Meng Ta, governor of Hsin-ch‘eng under the Wei\\nEmperor Wen Ti, was meditating defection to the House of Shu, and had\\nentered into correspondence with Chu-ko Liang, Prime Minister of that\\nState. The Wei general Ssu-ma I was then military governor of Wan, and\\ngetting wind of Meng Ta’s treachery, he at once set off with an army to\\nanticipate his revolt, having previously cajoled him by a specious message\\nof friendly import. Ssu-ma’s officers came to him and said: \\\"If Meng Ta\\nhas leagued himself with Wu and Shu, the matter should be thoroughly\\ninvestigated before we make a move.\\\" Ssu-ma I replied: \\\"Meng Ta is an\\nunprincipled man, and we ought to go and punish him at once, while he is\\nstill wavering and before he has thrown off the mask.\\\" Then, by a series of\\nforced marches, be brought his army under the walls of Hsin-ch‘eng with\\nin a space of eight days. Now Meng Ta had previously said in a letter to\\nChu-ko Liang: \\\"Wan is 1200 LI from here. When the news of my revolt\\nreaches Ssu-ma I, he will at once inform his imperial master, but it will be\\na whole month before any steps can be taken, and by that time my city will\\nbe well fortified. Besides, Ssu-ma I is sure not to come himself, and the\\ngenerals that will be sent against us are not worth troubling about.\\\" The\\nnext letter, however, was filled with consternation: \\\"Though only eight\\ndays have passed since I threw off my allegiance, an army is already at\\nthe city-gates. What miraculous rapidity is this!\\\" A fortnight later, Hsin-\\nch‘eng had fallen and Meng Ta had lost his head. [See CHIN SHU, ch.\\n1, f. 3.] In 621 A.D., Li Ching was sent from K‘uei-chou in Ssu-ch‘uan\\nto reduce the successful rebel Hsiao Hsien, who had set up as Emperor at\\nthe modern Ching-chou Fu in Hupeh. It was autumn, and the Yangtsze\\nbeing then in flood, Hsiao Hsien never dreamt that his adversary would\\nventure to come down through the gorges, and consequently made no pre-\\nparations. But Li Ching embarked his army without loss of time, and was\\njust about to start when the other generals implored him to postpone his\\ndeparture until the river was in a less dangerous state for navigation. Li\\nChing replied: \\\"To the soldier, overwhelming speed is of paramount im-\\nportance, and he must never miss opportunities.

He had invaded the Ch‘u State, where a universal levy\\nwas made to oppose him.

The answer was, that they were contending with one\\nanother in putting the weight and long-jumping. When Wang Chien heard\\nthat they were engaged in these athletic pursuits, he knew that their spir-\\nits had been strung up to the required pitch and that they were now ready\\nfor fighting. By this time the Ch‘u army, after repeating their challenge\\nagain and again, had marched away eastwards in disgust. The Ch‘in gen-\\neral immediately broke up his camp and followed them, and in the battle\\nthat ensued they were routed with great slaughter. Shortly afterwards, the\\nwhole of Ch‘u was conquered by Ch‘in, and the king Fu-ch‘u led into\\ncaptivity.]\\nKeep your army continually on the move,\\n[In order that the enemy may never know exactly where you are.

The story runs thus in the HOU HAN SHU, ch. 47: \\\"When Pan\\nCh‘ao arrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the country, received him\\nat first with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards his be-\\nhavior underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss and negligent.\\nPan Ch‘ao spoke about this to the officers of his suite: ’Have you no-\\nticed,’ he said, ’that Kuang’s polite intentions are on the wane? This must\\nsignify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians, and that con-\\nsequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with which side to\\nthrow in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly wise man, we are\\ntold, can perceive things before they have come to pass; how much more,\\nthen, those that are already manifest!’ Thereupon he called one of the nat-\\nives who had been assigned to his service, and set a trap for him, saying:\\n’Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu who arrived some day ago?’\\nThe man was so taken aback that between surprise and fear he presently\\nblurted out the whole truth. Pan Ch‘ao, keeping his informant carefully\\nunder lock and key, then summoned a general gathering of his officers,\\nthirty-six in all, and began drinking with them. When the wine had moun-\\nted into their heads a little, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by\\naddressing them thus: ’Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated\\nregion, anxious to achieve riches and honor by some great exploit. Now it\\nhappens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom\\nonly a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy extended\\ntowards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this envoy prevail\\nupon him to seize our party and hand us over to the Hsiung-no, our bones\\nwill become food for the wolves of the desert.

To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not\\nbefit a warlike prince.\\n54. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows it-\\nself in preventing the concentration of the enemy’s forces. He overawes\\nhis opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.\\n[Mei Tao-ch‘en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so much\\naffected by the Chinese: \\\"In attacking a powerful state, if you can divide\\nher forces, you will have a superiority in strength; if you have a superi-\\nority in strength, you will overawe the enemy; if you overawe the enemy,\\nthe neighboring states will be frightened; and if the neighboring states are\\nfrightened, the enemy’s allies will be prevented from joining her.\\\" The fol-\\nlowing gives a stronger meaning: \\\"If the great state has once been defeated\\n(before she has had time to summon her allies), then the lesser states will\\nhold aloof and refrain from massing their forces.\\\" Ch‘en Hao and Chang\\nYu take the sentence in quite another way. The former says: \\\"Powerful\\nthough a prince may be, if he attacks a large state, he will be unable to\\nraise enough troops, and must rely to some extent on external aid; if he\\ndispenses with this, and with overweening confidence in his own strength,\\nsimply tries to intimidate the enemy, he will surely be defeated.\\\" Chang Yu\\nputs his view thus: \\\"If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people\\nwill be discontented and hang back. But if (as will then be the case) our\\ndisplay of military force is inferior by half to that of the enemy, the other\\nchieftains will take fright and refuse to join us.\\\"]\\n55. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he\\nfoster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs,\\nkeeping his antagonists in awe.\\n[The train of thought, as said by Li Ch‘uan, appears to be this: Secure\\nagainst a combination of his enemies, \\\"he can afford to reject entangling\\nalliances and simply pursue his own secret designs, his prestige enable him\\nto dispense with external friendships.\\\"]\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2959,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"rimjg1Hb9nJMws/AcLQJnuyCk3szqHXHXn9Osoj24VI=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"cd542208-9a81-410d-8563-f1fab20481ce":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"cd542208-9a81-410d-8563-f1fab20481ce\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":111,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf_111\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":111,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864405377-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"QtUL8NcgAd7+blyLZopuh4LK06g3CS0w0mPC8fkwN5M=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 12.

THE NINE SITUATIONS 111\\n[These words of Sun Tzu were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation\\nof the tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already al-\\nluded to on p. 28. In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao,\\nand halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the\\nenemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body\\nof 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red flag.\\nTheir instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles and keep\\na secret watch on the enemy. \\\"When the men of Chao see me in full flight,\\\"\\nHan Hsin said, \\\"they will abandon their fortifications and give chase. This\\nmust be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down the Chao standards and\\nset up the red banners of Han in their stead.\\\" Turning then to his other\\nofficers, he remarked: \\\"Our adversary holds a strong position, and is not\\nlikely to come out and attack us until he sees the standard and drums of\\nthe commander-in-chief, for fear I should turn back and escape through\\nthe mountains.\\\" So saying, he first of all sent out a division consisting of\\n10,000 men, and ordered them to form in line of battle with their backs to\\nthe River Ti. Seeing this maneuver, the whole army of Chao broke into\\nloud laughter. By this time it was broad daylight, and Han Hsin, display-\\ning the generalissimo’s flag, marched out of the pass with drums beating,\\nand was immediately engaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, last-\\ning for some time; until at length Han Hsin and his colleague Chang Ni,\\nleaving drums and banner on the field, fled to the division on the river\\nbank, where another fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to\\npursue them and to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of\\nmen; but the two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was\\nfighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the 2000\\nhorsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men of Chao fol-\\nlowing up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls, tore\\nup the enemy’s flags and replaced them by those of Han. When the Chao\\narmy looked back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags struck them\\nwith terror. Convinced that the Hans had got in and overpowered their\\nking, they broke up in wild disorder, every effort of their leader to stay\\nthe panic being in vain. Then the Han army fell on them from both sides\\nand completed the rout, killing a number and capturing the rest, amongst\\nwhom was King Ya himself.... After the battle, some of Han Hsin’s of-\\nficers came to him and said: \\\"In the ART OF WAR we are told to have\\na hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a river or marsh on the left front.\\n[This appears to be a blend of Sun Tzu and T‘ai Kung. See IX ss. 9, and\\nnote.] You, on the contrary, ordered us to draw up our troops with the\\nriver at our back. Under these conditions, how did you manage to gain\\nthe victory?\\\" The general replied: \\\"I fear you gentlemen have not stud-\\nied the Art of War with sufficient care.

If we set fire to it at night,\\nthey will be thrown into a panic, and we can make a sortie and attack\\nthem on all sides at once, thus emulating the achievement of T‘ien Tan.’\\n[See p. 90.] That same evening, a strong breeze sprang up; so Huang-fu\\nSung instructed his soldiers to bind reeds together into torches and mount\\nguard on the city walls, after which he sent out a band of daring men, who\\nstealthily made their way through the lines and started the fire with loud\\nshouts and yells. Simultaneously, a glare of light shot up from the city\\nwalls, and Huang-fu Sung, sounding his drums, led a rapid charge, which\\nthrew the rebels into confusion and put them to headlong flight.\\\" [HOU\\nHAN SHU, ch. 71.] ]\\n10. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the\\nleeward.\\n[Chang Yu, following Tu Yu, says: \\\"When you make a fire, the enemy will\\nretreat away from it; if you oppose his retreat and attack him then, he will\\nfight desperately, which will not conduce to your success.\\\" A rather more\\nobvious explanation is given by Tu Mu: \\\"If the wind is in the east, begin\\nburning to the east of the enemy, and follow up the attack yourself from\\nthat side. If you start the fire on the east side, and then attack from the\\nwest, you will suffer in the same way as your enemy.\\\"]\\n11. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.\\n[Cf. Lao Tzu’s saying: \\\"A violent wind does not last the space of a morn-\\ning.\\\" (TAO TE CHING, chap. 23.) Mei Yao-ch‘en and Wang Hsi say: \\\"A\\nday breeze dies down at nightfall, and a night breeze at daybreak. This\\nis what happens as a general rule.\\\" The phenomenon observed may be\\ncorrect enough, but how this sense is to be obtained is not apparent.]\\n12. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known,\\nthe movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper\\ndays.\\n[Tu Mu says: \\\"We must make calculations as to the paths of the stars,\\nand watch for the days on which wind will rise, before making our attack\\nwith fire.\\\" Chang Yu seems to interpret the text differently: \\\"We must not\\nonly know how to assail our opponents with fire, but also be on our guard\\nagainst similar attacks from them.\\\"]\\n13.

This is\\nthe reason, Chang Yu concludes, why the former is dismissed in a couple\\nof sentences, whereas the attack by fire is discussed in detail. Wu Tzu (ch.\\n4) speaks thus of the two elements: \\\"If an army is encamped on low-lying\\nmarshy ground, from which the water cannot run off, and where the rain-\\nfall is heavy, it may be submerged by a flood. If an army is encamped in\\nwild marsh lands thickly overgrown with weeds and brambles, and visited\\nby frequent gales, it may be exterminated by fire.\\\"]\\n15. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his\\nattacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of\\ntime and general stagnation.\\n[This is one of the most perplexing passages in Sun Tzu. Ts‘ao Kung says:\\n\\\"Rewards for good service should not be deferred a single day.\\\" And Tu\\nMu: \\\"If you do not take opportunity to advance and reward the deserving,\\nyour subordinates will not carry out your commands, and disaster will en-\\nsue.\\\" For several reasons, however, and in spite of the formidable array\\nof scholars on the other side, I prefer the interpretation suggested by Mei\\nYao-ch‘en alone, whose words I will quote: \\\"Those who want to make\\nsure of succeeding in their battles and assaults must seize the favorable\\nmoments when they come and not shrink on occasion from heroic meas-\\nures: that is to say, they must resort to such means of attack of fire, water\\nand the like.

Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the\\ngood general cultivates his resources.\\n[Tu Mu quotes the following from the SAN LUEH, ch. 2: \\\"The warlike\\nprince controls his soldiers by his authority, kits them together by good\\nfaith, and by rewards makes them serviceable.

Tu Mu says: \\\"Your surviving spy must be a man of\\nkeen intellect, though in outward appearance a fool; of shabby exterior,\\nbut with a will of iron. He must be active, robust, endowed with physical\\nstrength and courage; thoroughly accustomed to all sorts of dirty work,\\nable to endure hunger and cold, and to put up with shame and ignominy.\\\"\\nHo Shih tells the following story of Ta‘hsi Wu of the Sui dynasty: \\\"When\\nhe was governor of Eastern Ch‘in, Shen-wu of Ch‘i made a hostile move-\\nment upon Sha-yuan. The Emperor T‘ai Tsu [? Kao Tsu] sent Ta-hsi Wu\\nto spy upon the enemy. He was accompanied by two other men. All three\\nwere on horseback and wore the enemy’s uniform. When it was dark, they\\ndismounted a few hundred feet away from the enemy’s camp and stealthily\\ncrept up to listen, until they succeeded in catching the passwords used in\\nthe army. Then they got on their horses again and boldly passed through\\nthe camp under the guise of night-watchmen; and more than once, hap-\\npening to come across a soldier who was committing some breach of dis-\\ncipline, they actually stopped to give the culprit a sound cudgeling! Thus\\nthey managed to return with the fullest possible information about the en-\\nemy’s dispositions, and received warm commendation from the Emperor,\\nwho in consequence of their report was able to inflict a severe defeat on\\nhis adversary.\\\"]\\n14. Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations\\nto be maintained than with spies.\\n[Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch‘en point out that the spy is privileged to enter\\neven the general’s private sleeping-tent.]\\nNone should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should\\ngreater secrecy be preserved.\\n[Tu Mu gives a graphic touch: all communication with spies should be\\ncarried \\\"mouth-to-ear.\\\" The following remarks on spies may be quoted\\nfrom Turenne, who made perhaps larger use of them than any previous\\ncommander: \\\"Spies are attached to those who give them most, he who\\npays them ill is never served. They should never be known to anybody; nor\\nshould they know one another. When they propose anything very material,\\nsecure their persons, or have in your possession their wives and children as\\nhostages for their fidelity.

It is clearly the most efficient\\nway – measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity – of moving heavy materials to distant\\ndestinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must travel to\\ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can’t run without\\nrail, and the industry’s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American\\nbusinesses, railroads eat capital.\\nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad\\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted\\nother fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least\\n$500 billion to replicate those assets and decades to complete the job.\\nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain its present\\nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested,\\nbut it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries.\\nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years\\nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $1 1⁄2 billion annually. Ouch! That sort of\\ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall considerably short of\\nBNSF’s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad’s debt. And that we do not\\nintend to do.\\nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less\\nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That’s no\\nsurprise to me or Berkshire’s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a\\nsmall fraction of its replacement value.\\nNorth America’s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and\\nexported goods, etc. one-way for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for\\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization\\nof track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I\\nsit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees\\nworking under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions.\\nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the\\ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must\\ndeal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or\\nmentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car,\\nextraordinarily heavy train that can’t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be\\nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more\\ncommon in Europe and will always be with us.\\n12\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3108,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"5FgHNSxwNMBYvtmOESY6J6D48QKFaJTArBhmSytQuhM=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4758eede-589f-4145-8a39-4c39c1722424":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4758eede-589f-4145-8a39-4c39c1722424\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864549991-berkshire.pdf_12\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"xfuaVWSMuglvzPmAzHKKCmgdKL7/qj+qZUZVbvaCwao=\"}},\"text\":\"Wage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and\\nCongress. Additionally, American railroads are required to carry many dangerous products every\\nday that the industry would much rather avoid. The words “common carrier” define\\nrailroad responsibilities.\\nLast year BNSF’s earnings declined more than I expected, as revenues fell. Though fuel\\ncosts also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country’s inflation\\ngoals. This differential may recur in future negotiations.\\nThough BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five\\nsince our purchase. I believe that our vast service territory is second to none and that therefore our\\nmargin comparisons can and should improve.\\nI am particularly proud of both BNSF’s contribution to the country and the people who\\nwork in sub-zero outdoor jobs in North Dakota and Montana winters to keep America’s\\ncommercial arteries open. Railroads don’t get much attention when they are working but, were\\nthey unavailable, the void would be noticed immediately throughout America.\\nA century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of\\nBerkshire. You can count on that.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last year occurred at BHE. Most\\nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as\\nexpected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or\\neven bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California’s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii).\\nIn such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once\\nregarded as among the most stable industries in America.\\nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through\\na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior\\nperformance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely\\nbe required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that\\nutilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE’s\\nextensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some\\nyears from completion. Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the\\ncontinental United States.\\nWith this model employed by both private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on,\\neven if population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The “margin of safety”\\napproach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactory-\\nreturn pact has been broken in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such\\nruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground transmission may be\\nrequired but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay the staggering costs for such construction?\\n13\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3148,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"be+8KtU2NI53JPc+i0kEMoF8pXAGPEctHJ0bwLSKgzM=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5ff29ade-bbe3-40f6-92c0-b169026728dd":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5ff29ade-bbe3-40f6-92c0-b169026728dd\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864549991-berkshire.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"V91WeTvEwVsHIIef55c1DJVVe1TVNVqlRejhHyeOLbY=\"}},\"text\":\"At Berkshire, we have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred.\\nThese costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have increased – and will likely\\ncontinue to increase – if convective storms become more frequent.\\nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s forest-fire losses and can\\nintelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western\\nstates. It remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere.\\nOther electric utilities may face survival problems resembling those of Pacific Gas and\\nElectric and Hawaiian Electric. A confiscatory resolution of our present problems would obviously\\nbe a negative for BHE, but both that company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive\\nnegative surprises. We regularly get these in our insurance business, where our basic product is\\nrisk assumption, and they will occur elsewhere. Berkshire can sustain financial surprises but we\\nwill not knowingly throw good money after bad.\\nWhatever the case at Berkshire, the final result for the utility industry may be ominous:\\nCertain utilities might no longer attract the savings of American citizens and will be forced to\\nadopt the public-power model. Nebraska made this choice in the 1930s and there are many\\npublic-power operations throughout the country. Eventually, voters, taxpayers and users will\\ndecide which model they prefer.\\nWhen the dust settles, America’s power needs and the consequent capital expenditure will\\nbe staggering. I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns\\nand, along with Berkshire’s two partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nEnough about problems: Our insurance business performed exceptionally well last year,\\nsetting records in sales, float and underwriting profits. Property-casualty insurance (“P/C”)\\nprovides the core of Berkshire’s well-being and growth. We have been in the business for 57 years\\nand despite our nearly 5,000-fold increase in volume – from $17 million to $83 billion – we have\\nmuch room to grow.\\nBeyond that, we have learned – too often, painfully – a good deal about what types of\\ninsurance business and what sort of people to avoid. The most important lesson is that our\\nunderwriters can be thin, fat, male, female, young, old, foreign or domestic. But they can’t be\\noptimists at the office, however desirable that quality may generally be in life.\\nSurprises in the P/C business – which can occur decades after six-month or one-year\\npolicies have expired – are almost always negative. The industry’s accounting is designed to\\nrecognize this reality, but estimation mistakes can be huge. And when charlatans are involved,\\ndetection is often both slow and costly. Berkshire will always attempt to be accurate in its estimates\\nof future loss payments but inflation – both monetary and the “legal” variety – is a wild card.\\n14\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2972,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"pZhi7F3Ukano7XUtqwQoDhT2jofTVsg2y193ZcCh1ro=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4a406127-f9fc-45d6-a9a4-a3a48a792e70":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4a406127-f9fc-45d6-a9a4-a3a48a792e70\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864549991-berkshire.pdf_14\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":14,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864549991-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"h3mzE1rDsm3e/ql8c0XkQhxSwnoMtTC9cWc/goOEHxg=\"}},\"text\":\"I’ve told the story of our insurance operations so many times that I will simply direct\\nnewcomers to page 18.

Let’s dig deeper.\\nGreg Abel, who runs all non-insurance operations for Berkshire – and in all respects is\\nready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow – was born and raised in Canada (he still plays hockey).\\nIn the 1990s, however, Greg lived for six years in Omaha just a few blocks away from me. During\\nthat period, I never met him.\\nA decade or so earlier, Ajit Jain, who was born, raised and educated in India, lived with his\\nfamily in Omaha only a mile or so from my home (where I’ve lived since 1958). Both Ajit and his\\nwife, Tinku, have many Omaha friends, though it’s been more than three decades since they moved\\nto New York (in order to be where much of the action in reinsurance takes place).\\nMissing from the stage this year will be Charlie. He and I were both born in Omaha about\\ntwo miles from where you will sit at our May get-together. In his first ten years, Charlie lived\\nabout a half-mile from where Berkshire has long maintained its office. Both Charlie and I spent\\nour early years in Omaha public schools and were indelibly shaped by our Omaha childhood. We\\ndidn’t meet, however, until much later. (A footnote that may surprise you: Charlie lived under 15\\nof America’s 45 presidents. People refer to President Biden as #46, but that numbering counts\\nGrover Cleveland as both #22 and #24 because his terms were not consecutive.

Munger – The Architect of Berkshire Hathaway\\nCharlie Munger died on November 28, just 33 days before his 100 th birthday.\\nThough born and raised in Omaha, he spent 80% of his life

Consequently, it was not until 1959 when he was 35 that I first met him.\\nIn 1962, he decided that he should take up money management.\\nThree years later he told me – correctly! – that I had made a dumb decision in\\nbuying control of Berkshire. But, he assured me, since I had already made the move,\\nhe would tell me how to correct my mistake.\\nIn what I next relate, bear in mind that Charlie and his family did not have a\\ndime invested in the small investing partnership that I was then managing and whose\\nmoney I had used for the Berkshire purchase. Moreover, neither of us expected that\\nCharlie would ever own a share of Berkshire stock.\\nNevertheless, Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: “Warren, forget about\\never buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add\\nto it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses\\nat wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero,\\nBen Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.” With much back-sliding\\nI subsequently followed his instructions.\\nMany years later, Charlie became my partner in running Berkshire and,\\nrepeatedly, jerked me back to sanity when my old habits surfaced. Until his death, he\\ncontinued in this role and together we, along with those who early on invested with\\nus, ended up far better off than Charlie and I had ever dreamed possible.\\nIn reality, Charlie was the “architect” of the present Berkshire, and I acted as\\nthe “general contractor” to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision.\\nCharlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me\\ntake the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part\\nolder brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the\\nreins, and when I blundered he never – never –reminded me of my mistake.\\nIn the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those\\nwho had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten. Berkshire\\nhas become a great company. Though I have long been in charge of the construction\\ncrew; Charlie should forever be credited with being the architect.\\n2\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2412,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"BT2bZdvP9Dk1jYPgv5BfX6N5Es5Flz2HHnBFcnKFzlE=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f99c0ad5-c68e-46b5-b0ac-de34e1d5449d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f99c0ad5-c68e-46b5-b0ac-de34e1d5449d\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":2,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"jVoW/S+9KZrAs5HmW32aUugUkOi0ladPSE/aIfpCMCE=\"}},\"text\":\"BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\\nBerkshire has more than three million shareholder accounts.

We particularly like its vast oil\\nand gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though\\nthe economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven. Both of these activities are very\\nmuch in our country’s interest.\\nNot so long ago, the U.S. was woefully dependent on foreign oil, and carbon capture had\\nno meaningful constituency. Indeed, in 1975, U.S. production was eight million barrels of\\noil-equivalent per day (“BOEPD”), a level far short of the country’s needs. From the favorable\\nenergy position that facilitated the U.S. mobilization in World War II, the country had retreated to\\nbecome heavily dependent on foreign – potentially unstable – suppliers. Further declines in oil\\nproduction were predicted along with future increases in usage.\\n9\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2742,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"WF0KMEbwFqaT6+eELMNoKAgjIS4s2U8ORgbHarw+SBM=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"64c7520e-1349-40ea-8ca7-a1f07a13d5d0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"64c7520e-1349-40ea-8ca7-a1f07a13d5d0\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"7MFbeDGhCpjEdUp6oEc40PKNsySfkZjN41Q3fw0zvRc=\"}},\"text\":\"For a long time, the pessimism appeared to be correct, with production falling to five\\nmillion BOEPD by 2007.

I erred, however, in my expectations for both BNSF\\nand BHE. Let’s take a look at each.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nRail is essential to America’s economic future. It is clearly the most efficient\\nway – measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity – of moving heavy materials to distant\\ndestinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must travel to\\ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can’t run without\\nrail, and the industry’s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American\\nbusinesses, railroads eat capital.\\nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad\\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted\\nother fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least\\n$500 billion to replicate those assets and decades to complete the job.\\nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain its present\\nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested,\\nbut it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries.\\nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years\\nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $1 1⁄2 billion annually. Ouch! That sort of\\ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall considerably short of\\nBNSF’s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad’s debt. And that we do not\\nintend to do.\\nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less\\nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That’s no\\nsurprise to me or Berkshire’s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a\\nsmall fraction of its replacement value.\\nNorth America’s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and\\nexported goods, etc. one-way for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for\\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization\\nof track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I\\nsit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees\\nworking under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions.\\nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the\\ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must\\ndeal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or\\nmentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car,\\nextraordinarily heavy train that can’t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be\\nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more\\ncommon in Europe and will always be with us.\\n12\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3108,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"lM9D3OAyIwEBz6MnZA4MCPCefjAfzZcb0kFgYGsmRiw=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"d327aecd-4cc1-416f-8853-2b2df5593c81":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d327aecd-4cc1-416f-8853-2b2df5593c81\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_12\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"xvFfD2wX2+s6ljyB/zqxfjf5cASLXSEruVpGPl5TNJI=\"}},\"text\":\"Wage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and\\nCongress. Additionally, American railroads are required to carry many dangerous products every\\nday that the industry would much rather avoid. The words “common carrier” define\\nrailroad responsibilities.\\nLast year BNSF’s earnings declined more than I expected, as revenues fell. Though fuel\\ncosts also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country’s inflation\\ngoals. This differential may recur in future negotiations.\\nThough BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five\\nsince our purchase. I believe that our vast service territory is second to none and that therefore our\\nmargin comparisons can and should improve.\\nI am particularly proud of both BNSF’s contribution to the country and the people who\\nwork in sub-zero outdoor jobs in North Dakota and Montana winters to keep America’s\\ncommercial arteries open. Railroads don’t get much attention when they are working but, were\\nthey unavailable, the void would be noticed immediately throughout America.\\nA century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of\\nBerkshire. You can count on that.\\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last year occurred at BHE. Most\\nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as\\nexpected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or\\neven bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California’s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii).\\nIn such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once\\nregarded as among the most stable industries in America.\\nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through\\na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior\\nperformance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely\\nbe required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that\\nutilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE’s\\nextensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some\\nyears from completion. Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the\\ncontinental United States.\\nWith this model employed by both private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on,\\neven if population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The “margin of safety”\\napproach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactory-\\nreturn pact has been broken in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such\\nruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground transmission may be\\nrequired but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay the staggering costs for such construction?\\n13\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3148,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"QIztJp2JWOSVqvFdgSHAXaZxRK9egH28JXSXy+AYvxU=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"03137dc9-969b-4e4c-b20d-aac27db4dcc5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"03137dc9-969b-4e4c-b20d-aac27db4dcc5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735864949343-berkshire.pdf_13\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":13,\"total_pages\":16,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735864949343-berkshire.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"tyrkgHHy+TnWgA1H+G+4o3hXuLLHdVFRATTXd2FoBbc=\"}},\"text\":\"At Berkshire, we have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred.\\nThese costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have increased – and will likely\\ncontinue to increase – if convective storms become more frequent.\\nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s forest-fire losses and can\\nintelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western\\nstates.

Its introduction to Europe began in 1782 when a French\\nJesuit Father living in China, Joseph Amiot, acquired a copy of it, and translated it into\\nFrench. It was not a good translation because, according to Dr. Giles, \\\"[I]t contains a\\ngreat deal that Sun Tzu did not write, and very little indeed of what he did.\\\"\\nThe first translation into English was published in 1905 in Tokyo by Capt. E. F.\\nCalthrop, R.F.A. However, this translation is, in the words of Dr. Giles, \\\"excessively\\nbad.\\\" He goes further in this criticism: \\\"It is not merely a question of downright blun-\\nders, from which none can hope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent; hard\\npassages were willfully distorted or slurred over. Such offenses are less pardonable.\\nThey would not be tolerated in any edition of a Latin or Greek classic, and a similar\\nstandard of honesty ought to be insisted upon in translations from Chinese.\\\" In 1908\\na new edition of Capt. Calthrop’s translation was published in London. It was an im-\\nprovement on the first – omissions filled up and numerous mistakes corrected – but\\nnew errors were created in the process. Dr. Giles, in justifying his translation, wrote:\\n\\\"It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate of my own powers; but I could not\\nhelp feeling that Sun Tzu deserved a better fate than had befallen him, and I knew that,\\nat any rate, I could hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors.\\\"\\nClearly, Dr. Giles’ work established much of the groundwork for the work of later\\ntranslators who published their own editions. Of the later editions of the ART OF WAR\\nI have examined; two feature Giles’ edited translation and notes, the other two present\\nthe same basic information from the ancient Chinese commentators found in the Giles\\nedition. Of these four, Giles’ 1910 edition is the most scholarly and presents the reader\\nan incredible amount of information concerning Sun Tzu’s text, much more than any\\nother translation.\\nThe Giles’ edition of the ART OF WAR, as stated above, was a scholarly work.\\nDr. Giles was a leading sinologue at the time and an assistant in the Department of\\nOriental Printed Books and Manuscripts in the British Museum. Apparently he wanted\\nto produce a definitive edition, superior to anything else that existed and perhaps some-\\nthing that would become a standard translation. It was the best translation available for\\n50 years. But apparently there was not much interest in Sun Tzu in English- speaking\\ncountries since it took the start of the Second World War to renew interest in his work.\\nSeveral people published unsatisfactory English translations of Sun Tzu. In 1944, Dr.\\nGiles’ translation was edited and published in the United States in a series of military\\nscience books. But it wasn’t until 1963 that a good English translation (by Samuel B.\\nGriffith and still in print) was published that was an equal to Giles’ translation. While\\nthis translation is more lucid than Dr. Giles’ translation, it lacks his copious notes that\\nmake his so interesting.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3368,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"t6D1B9HZFnf2cUTEfiZpiP2cNLsUmk3rawRSjTW2kSY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0a63fe22-89eb-4afa-89ba-838bda98a27b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0a63fe22-89eb-4afa-89ba-838bda98a27b\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"MDGcnzTt+ny+QM5QsOeXgGc326VVP1+/buQOlYpF9CI=\"}},\"text\":\"CONTENTS 4\\nDr. Giles produced a work primarily intended for scholars of the Chinese civiliza-\\ntion and language. It contains the Chinese text of Sun Tzu, the English translation, and\\nvoluminous notes along with numerous footnotes. Unfortunately, some of his notes and\\nfootnotes contain Chinese characters; some are completely Chinese. Thus, a conver-\\nsion to a Latin alphabet etext was difficult. I did the conversion in complete ignorance\\nof Chinese (except for what I learned while doing the conversion). Thus, I faced the\\ndifficult task of paraphrasing it while retaining as much of the important text as I could.\\nEvery paraphrase represents a loss; thus I did what I could to retain as much of the text\\nas possible. Because the 1910 text contains a Chinese concordance, I was able to trans-\\nliterate proper names, books, and the like at the risk of making the text more obscure.\\nHowever, the text, on the whole, is quite satisfactory for the casual reader, a transform-\\nation made possible by conversion to an etext. However, I come away from this task\\nwith the feeling of loss because I know that someone with a background in Chinese\\ncan do a better job than I did; any such attempt would be welcomed.\\nBob Sutton\\nal876@cleveland.freenet.edu\\nbobs@gnu.ai.mit.edu\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":1265,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"Qc6oOYiCIfYpCcdmKOEImXBolCi4vrXWV7BUy50YNHs=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"36109af1-eb5e-4f8f-a60b-375377780022":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"36109af1-eb5e-4f8f-a60b-375377780022\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":6,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_6\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":6,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"fcmqf5qZgsvVIU+sTPDFTXzZ61usUMpvk0Zh+CtmlQc=\"}},\"text\":\"Chapter 1\\nINTRODUCTION\\n1.1 Sun Wu and his Book\\nSsu-ma Ch‘ien gives the following biography of Sun Tzu:1\\nSun Tzu Wu was a native of the Ch‘i State. His ART OF WAR brought\\nhim to the notice of Ho Lu,2 King of Wu.\\nHo Lu said to him: \\\"I have carefully perused your 13 chapters. May I\\nsubmit your theory of managing soldiers to a slight test?\\\"\\nSun Tzu replied: \\\"You may.\\\"\\nHo Lu asked: \\\"May the test be applied to women?\\\"\\nThe answer was again in the affirmative, so arrangements were made to\\nbring 180 ladies out of the Palace. Sun Tzu divided them into two com-\\npanies, and placed one of the King’s favorite concubines at the head of\\neach. He then bade them all take spears in their hands, and addressed\\nthem thus: \\\"I presume you know the difference between front and back,\\nright hand and left hand?\\\"\\nThe girls replied: Yes.\\nSun Tzu went on: \\\"When I say \\\"Eyes front,\\\" you must look straight ahead.\\nWhen I say \\\"Left turn,\\\" you must face towards your left hand.

When this had been done,\\nthe drum was sounded for the drill once more; and the girls went through\\nall the evolutions, turning to the right or to the left, marching ahead or\\nwheeling back, kneeling or standing, with perfect accuracy and precision,\\nnot venturing to utter a sound. Then Sun Tzu sent a messenger to the King\\nsaying: \\\"Your soldiers, Sire, are now properly drilled and disciplined, and\\nready for your majesty’s inspection.

He is mentioned in two other passages of the SHIH\\nCHI:\\nIn the third year of his reign [512 B.C.] Ho Lu, king of Wu, took the\\nfield with Tzu-hsu [i.e. Wu Yuan] and Po P‘ei, and attacked Ch‘u. He\\ncaptured the town of Shu and slew the two prince’s sons who had formerly\\nbeen generals of Wu. He was then meditating a descent on Ying [the\\ncapital]; but the general Sun Wu said: \\\"The army is exhausted. It is not\\nyet possible. We must wait\\\".... [After further successful fighting,] \\\"in the\\nninth year [506 B.C.], King Ho Lu addressed Wu Tzu-hsu and Sun Wu,\\nsaying: \\\"Formerly, you declared that it was not yet possible for us to enter\\nYing. Is the time ripe now?\\\" The two men replied: \\\"Ch‘u’s general Tzu-\\nch‘ang, 4 is grasping and covetous, and the princes of T‘ang and Ts‘ai both\\nhave a grudge against him. If Your Majesty has resolved to make a grand\\nattack, you must win over T‘ang and Ts‘ai, and then you may succeed.\\\"\\nHo Lu followed this advice, [beat Ch‘u in five pitched battles and marched\\ninto Ying.]5\\nThis is the latest date at which anything is recorded of Sun Wu. He does not appear to\\nhave survived his patron, who died from the effects of a wound in 496.\\nIn another chapter there occurs this passage:6\\nFrom this time onward, a number of famous soldiers arose, one after the\\nother: Kao-fan,7 who was employed by the Chin State; Wang-tzu,8 in the\\nservice of Ch‘i; and Sun Wu, in the service of Wu. These men developed\\nand threw light upon the principles of war.\\nIt is obvious enough that Ssu-ma Ch‘ien at least had no doubt about the reality of Sun\\nWu as an historical personage; and with one exception, to be noticed presently, he is\\nby far the most important authority on the period in question. It will not be necessary,\\ntherefore, to say much of such a work as the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU, which is\\nsupposed to have been written by Chao Yeh of the 1st century A.D. The attribution is\\nsomewhat doubtful; but even if it were otherwise, his account would be of little value,\\nbased as it is on the SHIH CHI and expanded with romantic details. The story of Sun\\nTzu will be found, for what it is worth, in chapter 2. The only new points in it worth\\nnoting are: (1) Sun Tzu was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu Tzu-hsu. (2) He is\\ncalled a native of Wu. (3) He had previously lived a retired life, and his contemporaries\\nwere unaware of his ability.\\nThe following passage occurs in the Huai-nan Tzu: \\\"When sovereign and ministers\\nshow perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tzu to encounter the foe.\\\"\\n4The appellation of Nang Wa.\\n5SHI CHI, ch. 31.\\n6SHI CHI, ch. 25.\\n7The appellation of Hu Yen, mentioned in ch. 39 under the year 637.\\n8Wang-tzu Ch‘eng-fu, ch. 32, year 607.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2853,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"ZpsOcvTc/DQTZVJNqgfcHXVAdo9yxPTvuOxzA48c66g=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"176a64ae-42ec-45cc-9739-f799dae23848":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"176a64ae-42ec-45cc-9739-f799dae23848\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"6h/GdTxpS41jMjhLGNeeBIeeNECm5q/4+Ay6ifKsgd8=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

Sun Wu’s father Sun P‘ing, rose\\nto be a Minister of State in Ch‘i, and Sun Wu himself, whose style was Ch‘ang-ch‘ing,\\nfled to Wu on account of the rebellion which was being fomented by the kindred of\\nT‘ien Pao. He had three sons, of whom the second, named Ming, was the father of Sun\\nPin. According to this account then, Pin was the grandson of Wu, which, considering\\nthat Sun Pin’s victory over Wei was gained in 341 B.C., may be dismissed as chronolo-\\ngical impossible. Whence these data were obtained by Teng Ming-shih I do not know,\\nbut of course no reliance whatever can be placed in them.\\nAn interesting document which has survived from the close of the Han period is\\nthe short preface written by the Great Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, or Wei Wu Ti, for his edition of Sun\\nTzu.

The SSU-MA FA says: \\\"If one\\nman slay another of set purpose, he himself may rightfully be slain.\\\" He\\nwho relies solely on warlike measures shall be exterminated; he who relies\\nsolely on peaceful measures shall perish. Instances of this are Fu Ch‘ai10\\non the one hand and Yen Wang on the other. 11 In military matters, the\\nSage’s rule is normally to keep the peace, and to move his forces only\\nwhen occasion requires.

He was a descendant of Wu.] 12 In his treatment of\\ndeliberation and planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the field, 13\\nclearness of conception, and depth of design, Sun Tzu stands beyond the\\nreach of carping criticism. My contemporaries, however, have failed to\\ngrasp the full meaning of his instructions, and while putting into practice\\nthe smaller details in which his work abounds, they have overlooked its\\nessential purport. That is the motive which has led me to outline a rough\\nexplanation of the whole.\\nOne thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit statement that the 13 chapters were\\nspecially composed for King Ho Lu. This is supported by the internal evidence of I. ss.\\n15, in which it seems clear that some ruler is addressed.\\nIn the bibliographic section of the HAN SHU, there is an entry which has given\\nrise to much discussion: \\\"The works of Sun Tzu of Wu in 82 P‘IEN (or chapters), with\\ndiagrams in 9 CHUAN.\\\" It is evident that this cannot be merely the 13 chapters known\\nto Ssu-ma Ch‘ien, or those we possess today. Chang Shou-chieh refers to an edition\\nof Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR of which the \\\"13 chapters\\\" formed the first CHUAN,\\nadding that there were two other CHUAN besides. This has brought forth a theory, that\\nthe bulk of these 82 chapters consisted of other writings of Sun Tzu – we should call\\nthem apocryphal – similar to the WEN TA, of which a specimen dealing with the Nine\\nSituations14 is preserved in the T‘UNG TIEN, and another in Ho Shin’s commentary.\\nIt is suggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzu had only written the\\n13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of question and\\nanswer between himself and the King. Pi I-hsun, the author of the SUN TZU HSU\\nLU, backs this up with a quotation from the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU: \\\"The King of\\nWu summoned Sun Tzu, and asked him questions about the art of war. Each time he\\nset forth a chapter of his work, the King could not find words enough to praise him.\\\"\\nAs he points out, if the whole work was expounded on the same scale as in the above-\\nmentioned fragments, the total number of chapters could not fail to be considerable.\\nThen the numerous other treatises attributed to Sun Tzu might be included. The fact\\nthat the HAN CHIH mentions no work of Sun Tzu except the 82 P‘IEN, whereas the\\nSui and T‘ang bibliographies give the titles of others in addition to the \\\"13 chapters,\\\" is\\ngood proof, Pi I-hsun thinks, that all of these were contained in the 82 P‘IEN. Without\\npinning our faith to the accuracy of details supplied by the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU,\\nor admitting the genuineness of any of the treatises cited by Pi I-hsun, we may see in\\nthis theory a probable solution of the mystery. Between Ssu-ma Ch‘ien and Pan Ku\\nthere was plenty of time for a luxuriant crop of forgeries to have grown up under the\\nmagic name of Sun Tzu, and the 82 P‘IEN may very well represent a collected edition\\nof these lumped together with the original work. It is also possible, though less likely,\\nthat some of them existed in the time of the earlier historian and were purposely ignored\\nby him.15\\n12The passage I have put in brackets is omitted in the T‘U SHU, and may be an interpolation. It was\\nknown, however to Chang Shou-chieh of the T‘ang dynasty, and appears in the T‘AI P‘ING YU LAN.\\n13Ts‘ao Kung seems to be thinking of the first part of chap. II, perhaps especially of ss. 8.\\n14See chap. XI.\\n15On the other hand, it is noteworthy that WU TZU, which is not in 6 chapters, has 48 assigned to it in the\\nHAN CHIH.

This, as Sun Hsing-yen points\\nout, is only a modest way of saying that he made an explanatory paraphrase, or in other\\nwords, wrote a commentary on it. On the whole, this theory has met with very little\\nacceptance. Thus, the SSU K‘U CH‘UAN SHU says: \\\"The mention of the 13 chapters\\nin the SHIH CHI shows that they were in existence before the HAN CHIH, and that\\nlatter accretions are not to be considered part of the original work. Tu Mu’s assertion\\ncan certainly not be taken as proof.\\\"\\nThere is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters existed in the time of\\nSsu-ma Ch‘ien practically as we have them now. That the work was then well known\\nhe tells us in so many words. \\\"Sun Tzu’s 13 Chapters and Wu Ch‘i’s Art of War are the\\ntwo books that people commonly refer to on the subject of military matters. Both of\\nthem are widely distributed, so I will not discuss them here.\\\" But as we go further back,\\nserious difficulties begin to arise. The salient fact which has to be faced is that the TSO\\nCHUAN, the greatest contemporary record, makes no mention whatsoever of Sun Wu,\\neither as a general or as a writer. It is natural, in view of this awkward circumstance,\\nthat many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story of Sun Wu as given in the\\nSHIH CHI, but even show themselves frankly skeptical as to the existence of the man\\nat all. The most powerful presentment of this side of the case is to be found in the\\nfollowing disposition by Yeh Shui-hsin:16\\nIt is stated in Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s history that Sun Wu was a native of the Ch‘i\\nState, and employed by Wu; and that in the reign of Ho Lu he crushed\\nCh‘u, entered Ying, and was a great general. But in Tso’s Commentary no\\nSun Wu appears at all. It is true that Tso’s Commentary need not contain\\nabsolutely everything that other histories contain. But Tso has not omitted\\nto mention vulgar plebeians and hireling ruffians such as Ying K‘ao-shu,17\\nTs‘ao Kuei,18, Chu Chih-wu and Chuan She-chu19. In the case of Sun\\nWu, whose fame and achievements were so brilliant, the omission is much\\nmore glaring. Again, details are given, in their due order, about his con-\\ntemporaries Wu Yuan and the Minister P‘ei.20 Is it credible that Sun Wu\\nalone should have been passed over?\\nIn point of literary style, Sun Tzu’s work belongs to the same school as\\nKUAN TZU,21 LIU T‘AO,22 and the YUEH YU23 and may have been the\\nproduction of some private scholar living towards the end of the \\\"Spring\\nthe case of very short works, one is tempted to think that P‘IEN might simply mean \\\"leaves.\\\"\\n16Yeh Shih of the Sung dynasty [1151-1223].\\n17He hardly deserves to be bracketed with assassins.\\n18See Chapter 7, ss. 27 and Chapter 11, ss. 28.\\n19See Chapter 11, ss. 28.

Moreover, as\\nwe know that Wu Yuan and Po P‘ei both took part in the expedition, and also that its\\nsuccess was largely due to the dash and enterprise of Fu Kai, Ho Lu’s younger brother,\\nit is not easy to see how yet another general could have played a very prominent part\\nin the same campaign.\\nCh‘en Chen-sun of the Sung dynasty has the note:\\nMilitary writers look upon Sun Wu as the father of their art. But the fact\\nthat he does not appear in the TSO CHUAN, although he is said to have\\nserved under Ho Lu King of Wu, makes it uncertain what period he really\\nbelonged to.\\nHe also says:\\nThe works of Sun Wu and Wu Ch‘i may be of genuine antiquity.\\nIt is noticeable that both Yeh Shui-hsin and Ch‘en Chen-sun, while rejecting the per-\\nsonality of Sun Wu as he figures in Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s history, are inclined to accept the\\ndate traditionally assigned to the work which passes under his name. The author of\\nthe HSU LU fails to appreciate this distinction, and consequently his bitter attack on\\nCh‘en Chen-sun really misses its mark.

most\\nshameless offenders in this respect are Wu Ch‘i and Huai-nan Tzu, both of them im-\\nportant historical personages in their day.The former lived only a century after the\\nalleged date of Sun Tzu, and his death is known to have taken place in 381 B.C.It was\\nto him, according to Liu Hsiang, that Tseng Shen delivered the TSO CHUAN, which\\nhad been entrusted to him by its author.28 Now the fact that quotations from the ART\\nOF WAR, acknowledged or otherwise, are to be found in so many authors of differ-\\nent epochs, establishes a very strong anterior to them all, – in other words, that Sun\\nTzu’s treatise was already in existence towards the end of the 5th century B.C.Further\\nproof of Sun Tzu’s antiquity is furnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings\\nattaching to a number of the words he uses.A list of these, which might perhaps be\\nextended, is given in the HSU LU; and though some of the interpretations are doubtful,\\nthe main argument is hardly affected thereby.Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh\\nShui- hsin, a scholar and critic of the first rank, deliberately pronounces the style of the\\n13 chapters to belong to the early part of the fifth century.Seeing that he is actually\\nengaged in an attempt to disprove the existence of Sun Wu himself, we may be sure that\\nhe would not have hesitated to assign the work to a later date had he not honestly be-\\nlieved the contrary.And it is precisely on such a point that the judgment of an educated\\nChinaman will carry most weight.Other internal evidence is not far to seek.Thus in\\nXIII.ss.1, there is an unmistakable allusion to the ancient system of land-tenure which\\nhad already passed away by the time of Mencius, who was anxious to see it revived in\\na modified form.29 The only warfare Sun Tzu knows is that carried on between the\\nvarious feudal princes, in which armored chariots play a large part.Their use seems to\\nhave entirely died out before the end of the Chou dynasty.He speaks as a man of Wu,\\na state which ceased to exist as early as 473 B.C.On this I shall touch presently.But once refer the work to the 5th century or earlier, and the chances of its being\\nother than a bona fide production are sensibly diminished.The great age of forgeries\\ndid not come until long after.That it should have been forged in the period immedi-\\nately following 473 is particularly unlikely, for no one, as a rule, hastens to identify\\nhimself with a lost cause.As for Yeh Shui-hsin’s theory, that the author was a literary\\nrecluse, that seems to me quite untenable.If one thing is more apparent than another\\nafter reading the maxims of Sun Tzu, it is that their essence has been distilled from\\na large store of personal observation and experience.They reflect the mind not only\\nof a born strategist, gifted with a rare faculty of generalization, but also of a practical\\nsoldier closely acquainted with the military conditions of his time.To say nothing of\\nthe fact that these sayings have been accepted and endorsed by all the greatest captains\\nof Chinese history, they offer a combination of freshness and sincerity, acuteness and\\ncommon sense, which quite excludes the idea that they were artificially concocted in\\nthe study.If we admit, then, that the 13 chapters were the genuine production of a\\nmilitary man living towards the end of the \\\"CH‘UN CH‘IU\\\" period, are we not bound,\\nin spite of the silence of the TSO CHUAN, to accept Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s account in its\\nentirety?In view of his high repute as a sober historian,

There is still one grave, if not fatal, objec-\\ntion to the chronology involved in the story as told in the SHIH CHI, which, so far as I\\nam aware, nobody has yet pointed out. There are two passages in Sun Tzu in which he\\nalludes to contemporary affairs. The first in in VI. ss. 21:\\nThough according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in\\nnumber, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say\\nthen that victory can be achieved.\\nThe other is in XI. ss. 30:\\nAsked if an army can be made to imitate the SHUAI-JAN, I should answer,\\nYes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are\\ncrossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come\\nto each other’s assistance just as the left hand helps the right.\\nThese two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of composition.\\nThey assign the work to the period of the struggle between Wu and Yueh. So much\\nhas been observed by Pi I-hsun. But what has hitherto escaped notice is that they also\\nseriously impair the credibility of Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s narrative. As we have seen above,\\nthe first positive date given in connection with Sun Wu is 512 B.C. He is then spoken\\nof as a general, acting as confidential adviser to Ho Lu, so that his alleged introduction\\nto that monarch had already taken place, and of course the 13 chapters must have been\\nwritten earlier still. But at that time, and for several years after, down to the capture\\nof Ying in 506, Ch‘u and not Yueh, was the great hereditary enemy of Wu. The two\\nstates, Ch‘u and Wu, had been constantly at war for over half a century, 30 whereas the\\nfirst war between Wu and Yueh was waged only in 510, 31 and even then was no more\\nthan a short interlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with Ch‘u. Now\\nCh‘u is not mentioned in the 13 chapters at all. The natural inference is that they were\\nwritten at a time when Yueh had become the prime antagonist of Wu, that is, after Ch‘u\\nhad suffered the great humiliation of 506. At this point, a table of dates may be found\\nuseful.\\n30When Wu first appears in the CH‘UN CH‘IU in 584, it is already at variance with its powerful neighbor.\\nThe CH‘UN CH‘IU first mentions Yueh in 537, the TSO CHUAN in 601.\\n31This is explicitly stated in the TSO CHUAN, XXXII, 2.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2454,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"6NYNqjGramhWsju2dGg3xSyUiIAEtpegCOp9i0GUbEQ=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b8e21b0e-3995-44df-805a-7d2ea0dcc47f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b8e21b0e-3995-44df-805a-7d2ea0dcc47f\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_15\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LJO1aepJh5AfE1vq3ZXXLQEXdax5tfI4UAE1aJfVb1U=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

It seems rather to imply that, for the moment at\\nleast, the tide had turned against Wu, and that she was getting the worst of the struggle.\\nHence we may conclude that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which\\ndate Yueh does not appear to have scored any notable success against Wu. Ho Lu died\\nin 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must have been during the period\\n505-496, when there was a lull in the hostilities, Wu having presumably exhausted\\nby its supreme effort against Ch‘u. On the other hand, if we choose to disregard the\\ntradition connecting Sun Wu’s name with Ho Lu, it might equally well have seen the\\nlight between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period 482-473, when Yueh was once\\nagain becoming a very serious menace.32 We may feel fairly certain that the author,\\nwhoever he may have been, was not a man of any great eminence in his own day.\\nOn this point the negative testimony of the TSO CHUAN far outweighs any shred of\\nauthority still attaching to the SHIH CHI, if once its other facts are discredited. Sun\\nHsing-yen, however, makes a feeble attempt to explain the omission of his name from\\nthe great commentary. It was Wu Tzu-hsu, he says, who got all the credit of Sun Wu’s\\nexploits, because the latter (being an alien) was not rewarded with an office in the State.\\nHow then did the Sun Tzu legend originate? It may be that the growing celebrity\\nof the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown to its author. It was felt\\nto be only right and proper that one so well versed in the science of war should have\\nsolid achievements to his credit as well. Now the capture of Ying was undoubtedly the\\ngreatest feat of arms in Ho Lu’s reign; it made a deep and lasting impression on all the\\nsurrounding states, and raised Wu to the short-lived zenith of her power. Hence, what\\nmore natural, as time went on, than that the acknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu,\\nshould be popularly identified with that campaign, at first perhaps only in the sense that\\nhis brain conceived and planned it; afterwards, that it was actually carried out by him\\n32There is this to be said for the later period, that the feud would tend to grow more bitter after each\\nencounter, and thus more fully justify the language used in XI. ss. 30.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3350,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"qNKk1MBYOsndbfu5RXjLwc8MjgEiiIX3G8ivC20JCPI=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"d88af06d-9a7f-4b3b-8ed9-35e8489e7de7":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d88af06d-9a7f-4b3b-8ed9-35e8489e7de7\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":16,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_16\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":16,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"mOzQe31tL1YwhCrnI7toLJ6bLZBplEFGb/MMw/qho/0=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 15\\nin conjunction with Wu Yuan,33 Po P‘ei and Fu Kai?\\nIt is obvious that any attempt to reconstruct even the outline of Sun Tzu’s life must\\nbe based almost wholly on conjecture. With this necessary proviso, I should say that he\\nprobably entered the service of Wu about the time of Ho Lu’s accession, and gathered\\nexperience, though only in the capacity of a subordinate officer, during the intense mil-\\nitary activity which marked the first half of the prince’s reign.34 If he rose to be a gen-\\neral at all, he certainly was never on an equal footing with the three above mentioned.\\nHe was doubtless present at the investment and occupation of Ying, and witnessed Wu’s\\nsudden collapse in the following year. Yueh’s attack at this critical juncture, when her\\nrival was embarrassed on every side, seems to have convinced him that this upstart\\nkingdom was the great enemy against whom every effort would henceforth have to be\\ndirected. Sun Wu was thus a well-seasoned warrior when he sat down to write his\\nfamous book, which according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the end,\\nrather than the beginning of Ho Lu’s reign. The story of the women may possibly have\\ngrown out of some real incident occurring about the same time. As we hear no more\\nof Sun Wu after this from any source, he is hardly likely to have survived his patron\\nor to have taken part in the death-struggle with Yueh, which began with the disaster at\\nTsuili.\\nIf these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain irony in the fate\\nwhich decreed that China’s most illustrious man of peace should be contemporary with\\nher greatest writer on war.\\n1.2 The Text of Sun Tzu\\nI have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzu’s text. The quo-\\ntations that occur in early authors go to show that the \\\"13 chapters\\\" of which Ssu-ma\\nCh‘ien speaks were essentially the same as those now extant. We have his word for it\\nthat they were widely circulated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from\\ndiscussing them on that account. Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface:\\nDuring the Ch‘in and Han dynasties Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR was in\\ngeneral use amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated\\nit as a work of mysterious import, and were unwilling to expound it for the\\nbenefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was the first to write\\na commentary on it.\\nAs we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that Ts‘ao Kung\\ntampered with the text. But the text itself is often so obscure, and the number of edi-\\ntions which appeared from that time onward so great, especially during the T‘ang and\\nSung dynasties, that it would be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed\\n33With Wu Yuan himself the case is just the reverse: – a spurious treatise on war has been fathered on him\\nsimply because he was a great general. Here we have an obvious inducement to forgery. Sun Wu, on the\\nother hand, cannot have been widely known to fame in the 5th century.\\n34From TSO CHUAN: \\\"From the date of King Chao’s accession [515] there was no year in which Ch‘u\\nwas not attacked by Wu.\\\"\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3134,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"WJevyG4NDrUQoSyzdQ7KG9LAJjP6/xu1e7W4GKniGtw=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9e3b14d7-2981-412a-b272-e2528abbcf85":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9e3b14d7-2981-412a-b272-e2528abbcf85\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":17,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_17\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":17,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"Bkgv65xcfI9UE771MvzfWU6FBBhPY5MjYfdEfcHK36A=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

Towards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the chief com-\\nmentaries on Sun Tzu were in existence, a certain Chi T‘ien-pao published a work in\\n15 CHUAN entitled \\\"Sun Tzu with the collected commentaries of ten writers.\\\" There\\nwas another text, with variant readings put forward by Chu Fu of Ta-hsing, which also\\nhad supporters among the scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun Hsing-\\nyen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no longer put into circula-\\ntion. Thus, until the end of the 18th century, the text in sole possession of the field\\nwas one derived from Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition, although no actual copy of that import-\\nant work was known to have survived. That, therefore, is the text of Sun Tzu which\\nappears in the War section of the great Imperial encyclopedia printed in 1726, the KU\\nCHIN T‘U SHU CHI CH‘ENG. Another copy at my disposal of what is practically\\nthe same text, with slight variations, is that contained in the \\\"Eleven philosophers of\\nthe Chou and Ch‘in dynasties\\\" [1758]. And the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop’s\\nfirst edition is evidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese channels.\\nSo things remained until Sun Hsing-yen [1752-1818], a distinguished antiquarian and\\nclassical scholar, who claimed to be an actual descendant of Sun Wu,35 accidentally\\ndiscovered a copy of Chi T‘ien-pao’s long-lost work, when on a visit to the library\\nof the Hua-yin temple.36 Appended to it was the I SHUO of Cheng Yu-Hsien, men-\\ntioned in the T‘UNG CHIH, and also believed to have perished. This is what Sun\\nHsing-yen designates as the \\\"original edition (or text)\\\" – a rather misleading name, for\\nit cannot by any means claim to set before us the text of Sun Tzu in its pristine purity.\\nChi T‘ien-pao was a careless compiler, and appears to have been content to reproduce\\nthe somewhat debased version current in his day, without troubling to collate it with\\nthe earliest editions then available. Fortunately, two versions of Sun Tzu, even older\\nthan the newly discovered work, were still extant, one buried in the T‘UNG TIEN, Tu\\nYu’s great treatise on the Constitution, the other similarly enshrined in the T‘AI P‘ING\\nYU LAN encyclopedia. In both the complete text is to be found, though split up into\\nfragments, intermixed with other matter, and scattered piecemeal over a number of dif-\\nferent sections. Considering that the YU LAN takes us back to the year 983, and the\\nT‘UNG TIEN about 200 years further still, to the middle of the T‘ang dynasty, the\\nvalue of these early transcripts of Sun Tzu can hardly be overestimated. Yet the idea of\\nutilizing them does not seem to have occurred to anyone until Sun Hsing-yen, acting\\nunder Government instructions, undertook a thorough recension of the text. This is his\\nown account:\\nBecause of the numerous mistakes in the text of Sun Tzu which his editors\\nhad handed down, the Government ordered that the ancient edition [of\\nChi T‘ien-pao] should be used, and that the text should be revised and\\ncorrected throughout. It happened that Wu Nien-hu, the Governor Pi Kua,\\nand Hsi, a graduate of the second degree, had all devoted themselves to\\n35Preface ad fin: \\\"My family comes from Lo-an, and we are really descended from Sun Tzu.

At any rate, the new edition, when ultimately produced, appeared\\nin the names of Sun Hsing-yen and only one co- editor Wu Jen-shi. They took the\\n\\\"original edition\\\" as their basis, and by careful comparison with older versions, as\\nwell as the extant commentaries and other sources of information such as the I SHUO,\\nsucceeded in restoring a very large number of doubtful passages, and turned out, on\\nthe whole, what must be accepted as the closes approximation we are ever likely to get\\nto Sun Tzu’s original work. This is what will hereafter be denominated the \\\"standard\\ntext.\\\"\\nThe copy which I have used belongs to a reissue dated 1877. it is in 6 PEN, form-\\ning part of a well-printed set of 23 early philosophical works in 83 PEN.37 It opens\\nwith a preface by Sun Hsing-yen (largely quoted in this introduction), vindicating the\\ntraditional view of Sun Tzu’s life and performances, and summing up in remarkably\\nconcise fashion the evidence in its favor. This is followed by Ts‘ao Kung’s preface to\\nhis edition, and the biography of Sun Tzu from the SHIH CHI, both translated above.\\nThen come, firstly, Cheng Yu-hsien’s I SHUO,38 with author’s preface, and next, a\\nshort miscellany of historical and bibliographical information entitled SUN TZU HSU\\nLU, compiled by Pi I-hsun. As regards the body of the work, each separate sentence is\\nfollowed by a note on the text, if required, and then by the various commentaries apper-\\ntaining to it, arranged in chronological order. These we shall now proceed to discuss\\nbriefly, one by one.\\n1.3 The Commentators\\nSun Tzu can boast an exceptionally long distinguished roll of commentators, which\\nwould do honor to any classic. Ou-yang Hsiu remarks on this fact, though he wrote\\nbefore the tale was complete, and rather ingeniously explains it by saying that the\\nartifices of war, being inexhaustible, must therefore be susceptible of treatment in a\\ngreat variety of ways.\\n1. TS‘AO TS‘AO or Ts‘ao Kung, afterwards known as Wei Wu Ti [A.D. 155-220].\\nThere is hardly any room for doubt that the earliest commentary on Sun Tzu\\nactually came from the pen of this extraordinary man, whose biography in the\\nSAN KUO CHIH reads like a romance. One of the greatest military geniuses\\nthat the world has seen, and Napoleonic in the scale of his operations, he was\\nespecially famed for the marvelous rapidity of his marches, which has found\\nexpression in the line \\\"Talk of Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, and Ts‘ao Ts‘ao will appear.\\\" Ou-\\nyang Hsiu says of him that he was a great captain who \\\"measured his strength\\nagainst Tung Cho, Lu Pu and the two Yuan, father and son, and vanquished\\n37See my \\\"Catalogue of Chinese Books\\\" (Luzac & Co., 1908), no. 40.\\n38This is a discussion of 29 difficult passages in Sun Tzu.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3072,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"4vvd3zdGXA5SxGkw2DRnwL+4tWFzP/uUpwhw15hLCC4=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9e360aec-0b02-46c1-a00c-424fadad9339":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9e360aec-0b02-46c1-a00c-424fadad9339\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":19,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_19\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":19,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"QxsD/OByQEzpp1kkot80AGnkOb1EndwZRMY+EDSnVGk=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 1.

The commentary which has come down to us under this name\\nis comparatively meager, and nothing about the author is known. Even his per-\\nsonal name has not been recorded. Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition places him after Chia\\nLin,and Ch‘ao Kung- wu also assigns him to the T‘ang dynasty,40 but this is a\\nmistake. In Sun Hsing-yen’s preface, he appears as Meng Shih of the Liang dyn-\\nasty [502-557]. Others would identify him with Meng K‘ang of the 3rd century.\\nHe is named in one work as the last of the \\\"Five Commentators,\\\" the others being\\nWei Wu Ti, Tu Mu, Ch‘en Hao and Chia Lin.\\n3. LI CH‘UAN of the 8th century was a well-known writer on military tactics. One\\nof his works has been in constant use down to the present day. The T‘UNG CHIH\\nmentions \\\"Lives of famous generals from the Chou to the T‘ang dynasty\\\" as\\nwritten by him.41 According to Ch‘ao Kung-wu and the T‘IEN-I-KO catalogue,\\nhe followed a variant of the text of Sun Tzu which differs considerably from\\nthose now extant. His notes are mostly short and to the point, and he frequently\\nillustrates his remarks by anecdotes from Chinese history.\\n4. TU YU (died 812) did not publish a separate commentary on Sun Tzu, his notes\\nbeing taken from the T‘UNG TIEN, the encyclopedic treatise on the Constitution\\nwhich was his life- work. They are largely repetitions of Ts‘ao Kung and Meng\\nShih, besides which it is believed that he drew on the ancient commentaries of\\nWang Ling and others. Owing to the peculiar arrangement of T‘UNG TIEN, he\\nhas to explain each passage on its merits, apart from the context, and sometimes\\nhis own explanation does not agree with that of Ts‘ao Kung, whom he always\\nquotes first. Though not strictly to be reckoned as one of the \\\"Ten Commentat-\\nors,\\\" he was added to their number by Chi T‘ien-pao, being wrongly placed after\\nhis grandson Tu Mu.\\n5. TU MU (803-852) is perhaps the best known as a poet – a bright star even in\\nthe glorious galaxy of the T‘ang period.

The gist of\\nSun Tzu’s work is thus summarized by him: \\\"Practice benevolence and justice,\\nbut on the other hand make full use of artifice and measures of expediency.\\\" He\\nfurther declared that all the military triumphs and disasters of the thousand years\\nwhich had elapsed since Sun Tzu’s death would, upon examination, be found to\\nuphold and corroborate, in every particular, the maxims contained in his book.\\nTu Mu’s somewhat spiteful charge against Ts‘ao Kung has already been con-\\nsidered elsewhere.\\n6. CH‘EN HAO appears to have been a contemporary of Tu Mu. Ch‘ao Kung-\\nwu says that he was impelled to write a new commentary on Sun Tzu because\\nTs‘ao Kung’s on the one hand was too obscure and subtle, and that of Tu Mu\\non the other too long-winded and diffuse. Ou-yang Hsiu, writing in the middle\\nof the 11th century, calls Ts‘ao Kung, Tu Mu and Ch‘en Hao the three chief\\ncommentators on Sun Tzu, and observes that Ch‘en Hao is continually attacking\\nTu Mu’s shortcomings. His commentary, though not lacking in merit, must rank\\nbelow those of his predecessors.\\n7. CHIA LIN is known to have lived under the T‘ang dynasty, for his commentary\\non Sun Tzu is mentioned in the T‘ang Shu and was afterwards republished by\\nChi Hsieh of the same dynasty together with those of Meng Shih and Tu Yu.\\nIt is of somewhat scanty texture, and in point of quality, too, perhaps the least\\nvaluable of the eleven.\\n8. MEI YAO-CH‘EN (1002-1060), commonly known by his \\\"style\\\" as Mei Sheng-\\nyu, was, like Tu Mu, a poet of distinction. His commentary was published with\\na laudatory preface by the great Ou-yang Hsiu, from which we may cull the fol-\\nlowing:\\nLater scholars have misread Sun Tzu, distorting his words and trying to make\\nthem square with their own one-sided views. Thus, though commentators have\\nnot been lacking, only a few have proved equal to the task. My friend Sheng-yu\\nhas not fallen into this mistake. In attempting to provide a critical commentary\\nfor Sun Tzu’s work, he does not lose sight of the fact that these sayings were in-\\ntended for states engaged in internecine warfare; that the author is not concerned\\nwith the military conditions prevailing under the sovereigns of the three ancient\\ndynasties,42 nor with the nine punitive measures prescribed to the Minister of\\nWar.43 Again, Sun Wu loved brevity of diction, but his meaning is always deep.\\nWhether the subject be marching an army, or handling soldiers, or estimating the\\nenemy, or controlling the forces of victory, it is always systematically treated; the\\nsayings are bound together in strict logical sequence, though this has been ob-\\nscured by commentators who have probably failed to grasp their meaning.

The personal name of this commentator is\\ngiven as above by Cheng Ch‘iao in the TUNG CHIH, written about the middle\\nof the twelfth century, but he appears simply as Ho Shih in the YU HAI, and Ma\\nTuan-lin quotes Ch‘ao Kung-wu as saying that his personal name is unknown.\\nThere seems to be no reason to doubt Cheng Ch‘iao’s statement, otherwise I\\nshould have been inclined to hazard a guess and identify him with one Ho Ch‘u-\\nfei, the author of a short treatise on war, who lived in the latter part of the 11th\\ncentury. Ho Shih’s commentary, in the words of the T‘IEN-I-KO catalogue,\\n\\\"contains helpful additions\\\" here and there, but is chiefly remarkable for the\\ncopious extracts taken, in adapted form, from the dynastic histories and other\\nsources.\\n11. CHANG YU. The list closes with a commentator of no great originality perhaps,\\nbut gifted with admirable powers of lucid exposition. His commentator is based\\non that of Ts‘ao Kung, whose terse sentences he contrives to expand and develop\\nin masterly fashion. Without Chang Yu, it is safe to say that much of Ts‘ao\\nKung’s commentary would have remained cloaked in its pristine obscurity and\\ntherefore valueless. His work is not mentioned in the Sung history, the T‘UNG\\nK‘AO, or the YU HAI, but it finds a niche in the T‘UNG CHIH, which also\\nnames him as the author of the \\\"Lives of Famous Generals.\\\"45\\nIt is rather remarkable that the last-named four should all have flourished within\\nso short a space of time. Ch‘ao Kung-wu accounts for it by saying: \\\"During\\nthe early years of the Sung dynasty the Empire enjoyed a long spell of peace,\\nand men ceased to practice the art of war. but when [Chao] Yuan-hao’s rebellion\\ncame [1038-42] and the frontier generals were defeated time after time, the Court\\nmade strenuous inquiry for men skilled in war, and military topics became the\\n44T‘UNG K‘AO, ch. 221.\\n45This appears to be still extant.

Hence it is that the commentators of Sun\\nTzu in our dynasty belong mainly to that period.46\\nBesides these eleven commentators, there are several others whose work has not come\\ndown to us.

The following short passage by him is\\npreserved in the YU HAI:53\\nSun Wu’s saying, that in war one cannot make certain of conquering,54 is\\nvery different indeed from what other books tell us.55 Wu Ch‘i was a man\\nof the same stamp as Sun Wu: they both wrote books on war, and they\\nare linked together in popular speech as \\\"Sun and Wu.\\\" But Wu Ch‘i’s\\nremarks on war are less weighty, his rules are rougher and more crudely\\nstated, and there is not the same unity of plan as in Sun Tzu’s work, where\\nthe style is terse, but the meaning fully brought out.\\nThe following is an extract from the \\\"Impartial Judgments in the Garden of Literature\\\"\\nby Cheng Hou:\\n46T‘UNG K‘AO, loc. cit.\\n47A notable person in his day.

Such works as the LUN YU, the I CHING and\\nthe great Commentary,56 as well as the writings of Mencius, Hsun K‘uang\\nand Yang Chu, all fall below the level of Sun Tzu.\\nChu Hsi, commenting on this, fully admits the first part of the criticism, although he\\ndislikes the audacious comparison with the venerated classical works.

Her long military annals stretch back\\nto a point at which they are lost in the mists of time. She had built the Great Wall\\nand was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries before the first\\nRoman legionary was seen on the Danube. What with the perpetual collisions of the\\nancient feudal States, the grim conflicts with Huns, Turks and other invaders after the\\ncentralization of government, the terrific upheavals which accompanied the overthrow\\nof so many dynasties, besides the countless rebellions and minor disturbances that have\\nflamed up and flickered out again one by one, it is hardly too much to say that the clash\\nof arms has never ceased to resound in one portion or another of the Empire.\\nNo less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom China can\\npoint with pride. As in all countries, the greatest are fond of emerging at the most\\nfateful crises of her history. Thus, Po Ch‘i stands out conspicuous in the period when\\nCh‘in was entering upon her final struggle with the remaining independent states. The\\nstormy years which followed the break-up of the Ch‘in dynasty are illuminated by\\nthe transcendent genius of Han Hsin. When the House of Han in turn is tottering to\\nits fall, the great and baleful figure of Ts‘ao Ts‘ao dominates the scene. And in the\\nestablishment of the T‘ang dynasty,one of the mightiest tasks achieved by man, the\\nsuperhuman energy of Li Shih-min (afterwards the Emperor T‘ai Tsung) was seconded\\nby the brilliant strategy of Li Ching. None of these generals need fear comparison with\\nthe greatest names in the military history of Europe.\\nIn spite of all this, the great body of Chinese sentiment, from Lao Tzu downwards,\\nand especially as reflected in the standard literature of Confucianism, has been consist-\\nently pacific and intensely opposed to militarism in any form. It is such an uncommon\\nthing to find any of the literati defending warfare on principle, that I have thought it\\nworth while to collect and translate a few passages in which the unorthodox view is\\nupheld.

Every animal with blood in its veins\\nand horns on its head will fight when it is attacked. How much more so\\nwill man, who carries in his breast the faculties of love and hatred, joy and\\nanger! When he is pleased, a feeling of affection springs up within him;\\nwhen angry, his poisoned sting is brought into play. That is the natural law\\nwhich governs his being.... What then shall be said of those scholars of\\nour time, blind to all great issues, and without any appreciation of relat-\\nive values, who can only bark out their stale formulas about \\\"virtue\\\" and\\n\\\"civilization,\\\" condemning the use of military weapons? They will surely\\nbring our country to impotence and dishonor and the loss of her rightful\\nheritage; or, at the very least, they will bring about invasion and rebellion,\\nsacrifice of territory and general enfeeblement. Yet they obstinately refuse\\nto modify the position they have taken up. The truth is that, just as in the\\nfamily the teacher must not spare the rod, and punishments cannot be dis-\\npensed with in the State, so military chastisement can never be allowed to\\nfall into abeyance in the Empire. All one can say is that this power will be\\nexercised wisely by some, foolishly by others, and that among those who\\nbear arms some will be loyal and others rebellious.57\\nThe next piece is taken from Tu Mu’s preface to his commentary on Sun Tzu:\\nWar may be defined as punishment, which is one of the functions of gov-\\nernment. It was the profession of Chung Yu and Jan Ch‘iu, both disciples\\nof Confucius. Nowadays, the holding of trials and hearing of litigation, the\\nimprisonment of offenders and their execution by flogging in the market-\\nplace, are all done by officials. But the wielding of huge armies, the throw-\\ning down of fortified cities, the hauling of women and children into cap-\\ntivity, and the beheading of traitors – this is also work which is done by\\nofficials. The objects of the rack and of military weapons are essentially\\nthe same. There is no intrinsic difference between the punishment of flog-\\nging and cutting off heads in war. For the lesser infractions of law, which\\nare easily dealt with, only a small amount of force need be employed:\\nhence the use of military weapons and wholesale decapitation.

But, at any rate, it has come about that the members of the governing\\nclass are quite afraid of enlarging on military topics, or do so only in a\\nshamefaced manner. If any are bold enough to discuss the subject, they are\\nat once set down as eccentric individuals of coarse and brutal propensities.\\nThis is an extraordinary instance in which, through sheer lack of reasoning,\\nmen unhappily lose sight of fundamental principles.\\nWhen the Duke of Chou was minister under Ch‘eng Wang, he regulated\\nceremonies and made music, and venerated the arts of scholarship and\\nlearning; yet when the barbarians of the River Huai revolted,59 he sallied\\nforth and chastised them. When Confucius held office under the Duke\\nof Lu, and a meeting was convened at Chia-ku,60 he said: \\\"If pacific ne-\\ngotiations are in progress, warlike preparations should have been made\\nbeforehand.\\\" He rebuked and shamed the Marquis of Ch‘i, who cowered\\nunder him and dared not proceed to violence. How can it be said that these\\ntwo great Sages had no knowledge of military matters?\\nWe have seen that the great Chu Hsi held Sun Tzu in high esteem. He also appeals to\\nthe authority of the Classics:\\nOur Master Confucius, answering Duke Ling of Wei, said: \\\"I have never\\nstudied matters connected with armies and battalions.\\\"61 Replying to K‘ung\\nWen-tzu, he said: I have not been instructed about buff-coats and weapons.\\\"\\nBut if we turn to the meeting at Chia-ku, we find that he used armed force\\nagainst the men of Lai, so that the marquis of Ch‘i was overawed. Again,\\nwhen the inhabitants of Pi revolted, the ordered his officers to attack them,\\nwhereupon they were defeated and fled in confusion. He once uttered the\\nwords: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\"62 And Jan Yu also said: \\\"The Sage exercises\\nboth civil and military functions.\\\"63 Can it be a fact that Confucius never\\nstudied or received instruction in the art of war? We can only say that he\\ndid not specially choose matters connected with armies and fighting to be\\nthe subject of his teaching.\\nSun Hsing-yen, the editor of Sun Tzu, writes in similar strain:\\nConfucius said: \\\"I am unversed in military matters.\\\"64 He also said: \\\"If\\nI fight, I conquer.\\\" Confucius ordered ceremonies and regulated music.\\nNow war constitutes one of the five classes of State ceremonial,65 and\\n59See SHU CHING, preface ss. 55.\\n60See SHIH CHI, ch. 47.\\n61Lun Yu, XV. 1.\\n62I failed to trace this utterance.\\n63Supra.\\n64Supra.\\n65The other four being worship, mourning, entertainment of guests, and festive rites.

Hence, the words\\n\\\"I am unversed in\\\" must be taken to mean that there are things which even\\nan inspired Teacher does not know. Those who have to lead an army and\\ndevise stratagems, must learn the art of war. But if one can command\\nthe services of a good general like Sun Tzu, who was employed by Wu\\nTzu-hsu, there is no need to learn it oneself. Hence the remark added by\\nConfucius: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\"\\nThe men of the present day, however, willfully interpret these words of\\nConfucius in their narrowest sense, as though he meant that books on the\\nart of war were not worth reading. With blind persistency, they adduce the\\nexample of Chao Kua, who pored over his father’s books to no purpose,66\\nas a proof that all military theory is useless. Again, seeing that books on\\nwar have to do with such things as opportunism in designing plans, and\\nthe conversion of spies, they hold that the art is immoral and unworthy of\\na sage. These people ignore the fact that the studies of our scholars and\\nthe civil administration of our officials also require steady application and\\npractice before efficiency is reached. The ancients were particularly chary\\nof allowing mere novices to botch their work.67 Weapons are baneful68\\nand fighting perilous; and useless unless a general is in constant practice,\\nhe ought not to hazard other men’s lives in battle.69 Hence it is essential\\nthat Sun Tzu’s 13 chapters should be studied.\\nHsiang Liang used to instruct his nephew Chi70 in the art of war. Chi got\\na rough idea of the art in its general bearings, but would not pursue his\\nstudies to their proper outcome, the consequence being that he was finally\\ndefeated and overthrown. He did not realize that the tricks and artifices\\nof war are beyond verbal computation. Duke Hsiang of Sung and King\\nYen of Hsu were brought to destruction by their misplaced humanity. The\\ntreacherous and underhand nature of war necessitates the use of guile and\\nstratagem suited to the occasion. There is a case on record of Confucius\\nhimself having violated an extorted oath,71 and also of his having left the\\nSung State in disguise.72 Can we then recklessly arraign Sun Tzu for dis-\\nregarding truth and honesty?\\n66See XIII. ss. 11, note.\\n67This is a rather obscure allusion to the TSO CHUAN, where Tzu-ch‘an says: \\\"If you have a piece of\\nbeautiful brocade, you will not employ a mere learner to make it up.\\\"\\n68Cf.

Ho\\nShih says: \\\"Haste may be stupid, but at any rate it saves expenditure of\\nenergy and treasure; protracted operations may be very clever, but they\\nbring calamity in their train.\\\" Wang Hsi evades the difficulty by remark-\\ning: \\\"Lengthy operations mean an army growing old, wealth being expen-\\nded, an empty exchequer and distress among the people; true cleverness\\ninsures against the occurrence of such calamities.\\\" Chang Yu says: \\\"So\\nlong as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable to clever dilat-\\noriness.\\\" Now Sun Tzu says nothing whatever, except possibly by implic-\\nation, about ill-considered haste being better than ingenious but lengthy\\noperations.

Wei Liao Tzu [4th cent. B.C.] says: ’Direct warfare\\nfavors frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.’ Ts‘ao Kung\\nsays: ’Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation; appearing on\\nthe enemy’s rear is an indirect maneuver.’ Li Wei-kung [6th and 7th cent.\\nA.D.] says: ’In war, to march straight ahead is CHENG; turning move-\\nments, on the other hand, are CH‘I.’ These writers simply regard CHENG\\nas CHENG, and CH‘I as CH‘I; they do not note that the two are mutually\\ninterchangeable and run into each other like the two sides of a circle [see\\ninfra, ss. 11]. A comment on the T‘ang Emperor T‘ai Tsung goes to the\\nroot of the matter: ’A CH‘I maneuver may be CHENG, if we make the\\nenemy look upon it as CHENG; then our real attack will be CH‘I, and vice\\nversa. The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot\\nfathom our real intent.’\\\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack\\nor other operation is CHENG, on which the enemy has had his attention\\nfixed; whereas that is CH‘I,\\\" which takes him by surprise or comes from\\nan unexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant\\nto be CH‘I,\\\" it immediately becomes CHENG.\\\"]\\n4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an\\negg - this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.\\n5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect\\nmethods will be needed in order to secure victory.\\n[Chang Yu says: \\\"Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding\\nthe enemy’s flanks or falling on his rear.\\\" A brilliant example of \\\"indirect\\ntactics\\\" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord Roberts’ night\\nmarch round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.1\\n6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhausible as Heaven and Earth,\\nunending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they\\nend but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once\\nmore.\\n[Tu Yu and Chang Yu understand this of the permutations of CH‘I and\\nCHENG.\\\" But at present Sun Tzu is not speaking of CHENG at all, un-\\nless, indeed, we suppose with Cheng Yu-hsien that a clause relating to\\nit has fallen out of the text. Of course, as has already been pointed out,\\nthe two are so inextricably interwoven in all military operations, that they\\ncannot really be considered apart.

Tu\\nMu, Ch‘en Hao, and Mei Yao-ch‘en assume the meaning to be: \\\"In order\\nto make your defense quite safe, you must defend EVEN those places that\\nare not likely to be attacked;\\\" and Tu Mu adds: \\\"How much more, then,\\nthose that will be attacked.\\\" Taken thus, however, the clause balances less\\nwell with the preceding–always a consideration in the highly antithetical\\nstyle which is natural to the Chinese. Chang Yu, therefore, seems to come\\nnearer the mark in saying: \\\"He who is skilled in attack flashes forth from\\nthe topmost heights of heaven [see IV. ss. 7], making it impossible for the\\nenemy to guard against him. This being so, the places that I shall attack\\nare precisely those that the enemy cannot defend.... He who is skilled in\\ndefense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth, making it impossible\\nfor the enemy to estimate his whereabouts. This being so, the places that I\\nshall hold are precisely those that the enemy cannot attack.\\\"]\\n8. Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know\\nwhat to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not\\nknow what to attack.\\n[An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.]\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2476,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"UEwsU+5QESV+Ti5pu/k0au8cO/gKiXmZOrYtNcaFQAs=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"52ae8848-ce5a-45c2-8004-8ad7f0d3a9e6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"52ae8848-ce5a-45c2-8004-8ad7f0d3a9e6\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":56,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf_56\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":56,\"total_pages\":130,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\266544\\\\web projects\\\\bird-chat\\\\llamaindex-express-api\\\\data\\\\1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"1735865261948-ArtOfWar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"ydGaJ/mpelHHitIxFy4WnFIG3OIWIiiua5AZwL97V3g=\"}},\"text\":\"CHAPTER 7.
